                                                            <p>Following <span data-page="page_1"></span>the North Vietnamese takeover of South Vietnam, many South Vietnamese people fled their country to live new lives in the United States. They became stateless refugees, struggling to hold on to their national identity while attempting to assimilate to America. The narrator, who was born in Vietnam but raised in America, begins to understand why the North Vietnamese adopted communism, going against everything that he learned from his superiors. The narrator struggles to hide his political ideologies, while maintaining his nationalistic facade.</p>
                                                            <p>Nguyen masterfully crafts a novel from the viewpoint of the underrepresented sympathizers of North Vietnam. Most of the media that is based on the Vietnamese war focuses on the American experience and involvement of the war. Most Americans grew up watching movies of cigarette-smoking, sunglass-wearing American soldiers firing machine guns into a jungle of North Vietna guerilla fighters. Instead, Nguyen writes about the espionage and tactical battle that went on behind the gun fights.  Nguyen shows the psychological and physical stress of being a double agent. For instance, the narrator takes part in two assassinations and instantly regrets his murders. His conscience becomes torn and he struggles to live through his crushing guilt.</p>
                                                            <p>The story is told through the lens of an anonymous narrator, and begins with a flashback to the state of South Vietnam in 1975, right near the fall of the state and the unification under the Socialist Republic of Vietnam following the successful takeover by the North Vietnamese. Here, fleeing South Vietnamese are executed, but a few lucky escape through ways such as an American rescue plane that Nguyen is forced to give to high ranking South Vietnamese Army officials to maintain his cover.</p>
                                                            <p>Throughout the entire story, the narrator struggles with the duality of his being. He is a spy for the North Vietnamese, yet feels terrible witnessing the torture of South Vietnamese by the communists. The narrator constantly struggles with his French and Vietnamese identity. Later in the novel, he continuously struggles with his Vietnamese identity while living in The United States, in admiration of the advancement of the country but annoyed by the air of superiority everywhere around the country.</p>
                                                            <p>Whether in ideology or loyalty, the narrator struggles to find either side as “right”. He is thrilled to see the downfall of the South Vietnamese, but understands the experiences of his fellow South Vietnamese soldiers whose families were ravaged by the communists. While his purpose is to help the North Vietnamese, he also feels grateful to the South Vietnamese general who raised him to become the man he is. The narrator also finds himself with conflicting loyalties between his North Vietnamese handler, Man, and his South Vietnamese friend Bon.</p>
                                                            <p>Nguyen is able to effectively develop the complexity of the duality of the narrators beings and his relationship with the others, while filling all holes and leaving the reader without any confusion in how they came to be. Despite this, the narrator is able to make the story a rollercoaster of emotions, and the story becomes anything but the expected.</p>
                                                            <p>The struggles with identity within oneself draws parallels with Barack Obama’s “Dreams from my father.” Former U.S. President Obama, who is also of mixed heritage, experienced different kinds of prejudice while in the lands of his mother’s and his father’s heritage. Whichever place both narrators go, different kinds of inner struggles meet them. However, whereas the focus of Obama’s inner struggle was more race related, the narrator in “The Sympathizer focused more on ideology and cultural differences. </p>
                                                            <p>In America, the narrator attempts to rekindle his nationalist identity. He mentioned that America only reminded him of the things that he loved in Vietnam. Nguyen humanizes the characters through their struggle of assimilating to American culture. Man and the narrator struggle to gain a foothold in America and have to resort to getting a sponsor from a church. They struggle to find work and attain a greater education. In this part of the novel, Nguyen writes in a comedic tone. Nguyen essentially writes a social commentary on American culture and occasionally cracks a joke. This addition of comedy feels out of place, as it offsets the vehement introduction. It also felt strange to transition from the social commentary to the proposed plot of a revolution in Vietnam.</p>

a new memoir by Aatish Taseer, is troubled by a single plaintive question: Does a city steeped in tradition have a future in modern India? The setting is Benares, the spiritual capital of Hinduism, where more than five million pilgrims flock each year to worship, bathe, and burn their dead. Dying while in Benares, it is said, will release a Hindu from the cycle of reincarnation, and Taseer discovers an industry of death that’s alive and well in the city. He describes corpses that “sizzled away on funeral pyres,” as dinghies drifted on the Ganges amid smoke and marigolds."],["p","Taseer, to be clear, has not come to Benares to die. He’s in his thirties for most of the memoir, and, anyway, he’s not religious. His pilgrimage is secular; he seeks to filter the contradictions of present-day India through his life story. In the process, “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Twice-Born-Life-Death-Ganges/dp/0374279608"},"The Twice-Born"],"” becomes a moving, if maundering, riff on what it means to be modern. For Taseer, Benares incarnates a curious quality of modernity: the city makes anthropologists of the devout and believers of the skeptical. The book’s charm resides in the way the author orbits this tension between faith and rationality. He yearns to make sense of how “the laws of reason and the laws of magic . . . reached an easy harmony” in contemporary India."],["p","Taseer attempts to focus the book on his interactions with Brahmins, Hinduism’s priestly caste. (They are the twice-born of the memoir’s title, because they are considered to be born a second time upon their scholarly initiation.) But Taseer is foremost a wanderer, and the roving form of the book echoes his penchant for circularity. He writes as though Benares, in all its many dimensions, can be apprehended only through overlapping, fractal perspectives, one of which is his own."],["p","Taseer’s relationship to himself is distinctly spectatorial; he cannot stop looking at himself looking at himself. “I saw everything as an Anglicized Indian watching an imaginary European or American visitor watch India,” he writes. “I wished I had a more direct relationship with my country. But any attempt to do so only made the self-observing selves multiply.” This double vision is a product of Taseer’s hybrid upbringing. He was born in England, in 1980, and raised in India. His father was the Pakistani politician Salman Taseer, who was murdered by his own bodyguard; his mother was an Indian journalist. These facts of life, coupled with extended stints in the United States, have steered him toward itinerancy, forever between cultures. V. S. Naipaul, Taseer’s former mentor, is repeatedly mentioned in the book, and it is written in his exilic spirit."],["p","In order to fashion a more authentic—or at least a less vexed—relationship to India, Taseer takes up Sanskrit. He admits that “my wish to learn Sanskrit was an attempt to deal intellectually with a country whose reality perturbed me,” but the language bequeaths him a vast literary inheritance. After roughly a decade of study, he begins to pore over Shakuntala, the most famous Sanskrit play, and to mine Indian literature for his own literary pursuits. This section of the memoir doubles as a brief lesson in history and literature. In describing how the British philologist William Jones “discovered” Sanskrit and noticed its affinity with Greek, Taseer nudges the reader toward his main thesis: history inheres in modernity. India’s future, in other words, lies in the recovery of what was forgotten or suppressed during the colonial encounter: its literary, cultural, and intellectual past."],["p","History, however, is distinct from tradition. The latter is dangerously pliable; anything can be justified in its name. Taseer realizes this near the end of his stay in Benares, when he absent-mindedly brings his driver along to a dinner hosted by a Brahmin family. As the dinner ends, a silence falls over the table. The host whispers to Taseer that, although the family has generously allowed the driver to eat with them, he must wash his own plate; his saliva has “polluted” the silverware. Taseer cannot bring himself to deliver the instruction, but the driver, once told by the host, is surprisingly unfazed. “You are like gods to me,” he replies."],["p","Episodes like this slowly disenchant Taseer. His reverence for the literary and spiritual traditions that the Brahmins embody is diminished by his growing awareness of the privileges they continue to wield, even in a modern democracy. “The spread of modernity in India threatened caste but also made the need to assert it more vehement,” he writes. “Brahmins continued to exert an outsize influence over intellectual life; the armed forces were still dominated by the martial castes; a majority of the rich businessmen and industrialists still belonged to the mercantile castes; and the lower castes still did the most wretched work.”"],["p","In these lines, Taseer adopts a historian’s tone, and he is fond of braiding his quest for knowledge with one-off quotes from scholars, writers, and experts. References to Dostoyevsky, T. S. Eliot, Octavio Paz, Mark Twain, and contemporary thinkers, such as the Indologist Sheldon Pollock, flit in and out of the narrative, pell-mell, but they offer an international precedent for India’s uneasy encounter with modernity. Nietzsche is not cited in Taseer’s book, but he would not have been out of place. In fact, in “On the Use and Abuse of History for Life,” Nietzsche neatly sums up Taseer’s evolving relationship to the Brahmins—and to modernity itself. To be",["inline-embed",{"type":"analytics","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22analytics%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22final%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":""}]," modern, for Nietzsche, is to radically forget the past. But he also warns, “this very life that has to forget must also at times be able to stop forgetting; then it will become clear how illegitimate the existence of something, of a privilege, a caste, or a dynasty actually is, and how much it deserves to be destroyed.”"],["p","Benares, it turns out, possesses a naturally levelling force. The city is suffused with a form of darkness that locals call ",["em","tamas"],", which “is inseparable from the chthonic energy of Shiva, the city’s presiding deity, and the god of creative dissolution,” Taseer writes. “The city deals in equal measures of light and shade. There is dirt and squalor, death and disease; but there is also the transcendent spectacle of the river, and the utter beauty of people lost in meditation, waist-deep in water.” The ",["em","tamasic"]," mood was elegantly characterized by one of the city’s best-known residents, the Swiss artist Alice Boner, who lived there from 1935 to 1978. Taseer stays in Boner’s former home, and the memoir is happily leavened with excerpts from her diary. “The terror of the utter loneliness of death,” she wrote, in 1954, “had given place to the feeling of the great community of death, the only real community, the only condition in which all differences are obliterated and all are one, merged into the same substance.”"],["p","“Alice came to be a friend across time,” Taseer writes, though the two writers arrive at vastly different conclusions following their stays in Benares. For Boner, the city annihilates the individual, while Taseer views it as a place to conjure a sense of self. His is a search for identity and narratable experience—indeed, for him the two are indistinguishable. But, by the memoir’s close, he has only circled the sense of clarity that he sought. Though he came to Benares to walk, talk, listen, and write, the ",["em","tamasic"]," charge of the city has not unshackled him from the paradigm of personal identity—of his desire, above all, to look inward. He is condemned, he muses, to live life as a perpetual drifter, never at home anywhere, the perfect chronicler of a vagabond modernity. And so he decides to uproot himself once more and move back to New York. The reason he gives is telling: even in Benares, “people would always be able to place me at glance—as English-speaking, as Muslim, as part of the class of interpreters.” The self-observing selves, it seems, have returned. The memoir thus ends where it begins: Taseer seeing himself seeing, with his eyes closed."]]],"canonicalUrl":"https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-twice-born-a-searching-memoir-about-indias-identity-crisis","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c8681ab3335f580f17f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c8681ab3335f580f17f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"India","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"india"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"India","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"india"},{"id":"5c2e1eed81ab3335f580f387","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1eed81ab3335f580f387","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Hinduism","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"hinduism"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Hinduism","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"hinduism"},{"id":"5c2e1c792bc86f2c9a244998","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c792bc86f2c9a244998","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Memoirs","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"memoirs"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Memoirs","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"memoirs"}],"sections":[{"id":"5908f18c98449f3364193dfd","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Sections","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"sections"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Sections","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"sections"},"slug":"books","children":[{"id":"5907eefc98449f3364193d6d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5907eefc98449f3364193d6d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Page-Turner","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"page-turner"},{"id":"5908f18c98449f3364193dfd","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"Page-Turner","parent":[{"id":"5908f18c98449f3364193dfd","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"h

/photos/5ddd530d1be66d0009d4194e]||||||\n+++\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nI grew up in the golden age of comics: the nineteen-forties, and most particularly, the five years immediately after the end of the Second World War. Comics were one of the main sources of entertainment for children then: there was not yet much television, and, although there were Saturday matinées, most films were for adults. On Saturday mornings, groups of children would congregate around the stashes of comics that had been collected to have comic-book orgies. The comics were read and reread; they were also traded.  \n\nAmong those collected and traded at our place were “Little Lulu”s. They were read by boys as well as girls—bratty kids were universally appealing to bratty kids, which all of us were, some of the time, in those years when kids were allowed to roam freely as long as they came home before dark. The things Lulu and her pals and frenemies got up to behind the backs of their oblivious parents were close to our own experiences, and being able to think your way out of a tight spot you’d got yourself into was a skill we all wished to have.  \n\nBut Lulu had a special significance for me, because she had curls and so did I. Curly hair went in and out of fashion—Twiggy was to get revenge on behalf of the straight-haired in the late nineteen-sixties—but, in the Shirley Temple-dominated nineteen-forties, curls were at a premium, and it was horrifying for me to witness the Torquemada-like tortures inflicted on my friends’ heads by their mothers: their hair was twisted up in damp rags and secured with bobby pins at night, producing, in the morning, a few limp spirals of hair that would quickly wilt. Whereas Lulu and I were all set! Soon I would surely get a job selling that new consumer item, Kleenex, just like her. (This failed to happen.)  \n\nBut Lulu had a few other things going for her, in my eyes. She was little, as was I, but this did not stop her for an instant. The eternal problem of the boys’ clubhouse—not being let into it, that is—was treated by her, by and large, with a *phnuh*. She had other, better things to do, and anyway, she—being the title character—was smarter, so there. And, in an age somewhat devoid of female title characters, she was the title character. One could therefore be little, and a girl, and *nonetheless* the title character. Move over, Jane Eyre!  \n\nBut most of all Lulu was a storyteller. The episodes I remember most clearly were those in which Lulu resorts to tale-spinning in order to soothe the savage breast of the pesky and persistent Alvin. Her tales featured a poor little girl identical to Lulu who picked beebleberries and sold them, but frequently ran afoul of a wicked witch called Hazel. (Witch Hazel: get it? Lulu was not averse to puns.) Witch Hazel was a formidable adversary, but the “Little Lulu” avatar always won out in the end, through a mixture of inventiveness, deviousness, and trickery—joining a long list of female heroines from folktales and epics—and, more recently, novels—who have done the same. Lulu also indulged in a certain amount of snooping—hiding in the bushes and eavesdropping—and is thus in the line of famous female spies and detectives, from Sally the Sleuth to Josephine Baker. She is brave but not stupid: when in doubt, she runs away very fast. All of these are qualities to be admired.  \n\nLittle Lulu made her stories up as she went along, which was the approach my brother and I took to the serial narratives we were in the habit of concocting, taking turns as we got tired. Like us, Lulu frequently left off in midstory, thus leaving Alvin clamoring for more. It was a good exercise in the value of suspense. Lulu is thus in the lineage of female wordspinners that includes Scheherazade, giving us the equation: Scheherazade is to the Sultan as Little Lulu is to Alvin. It’s a stretch, I know, but what the heck.  \n\nI loved the beebleberry stories as a child. Any berry you couldn’t identify became a beebleberry, and so it remains to this very day. The difference is that Lulu’s beebleberries were edible, whereas you should never eat my kind of beebleberries until you find out what they are. At which point they cease to be beebleberries.  \n\nLittle Lulu never grew up. Like Peter Pan, another child trickster, she remained little. But I did grow up, more or less, eventually, though not enough to become tall. What would Bigger Lulu have been like? I now wonder. I prefer to think she would have been a writer of some kind; certainly a storyteller.  \n\nAs one of those myself, I am frequently asked about my influences. I haven’t yet cited “Little Lulu,” but I will do so now. What were the life lessons taught to me by this diminutive but curly-headed prankster?  \n\n1\\. It’s O.K. to have curls.  \n\n2\\. It’s O.K. to be short.  \n\n3\\. It’s O.K. to be female.  \n\n4\\. Storytelling is a skill, and putting beebleberries, witches or witch substitutes, and suspense into the mixture definitely leavens the lump.  \n\n5\\. If you hide in the bushes and eavesdrop, you can learn some very useful things. Just don’t sneeze.  \n\nSo, here’s to “Little Lulu”! Thanks to her for many hours of entertainment and instruction, and long may the beebleberries flourish. \n\nSee below for an excerpt from a new anthology published this month, “Little Lulu: Working Girl.” \n*All images courtesy Classic Media, LLC and Drawn & Quarterly.*\n\n+++feature-small\n[#image: /photos/5dd6f78f99e2d500087eb2e6]||||||\n+++\n+++feature-small\n[#image:

aunt shared with her a family legend about a possible seventeenth-century forebear: Mary Webster, whose neighbors, in the Puritan town of Hadley, Massachusetts, had accused her of witchcraft. “The townspeople didn’t like her, so they strung her up,” Atwood said recently. “But it was before the age of drop hanging, and she didn’t die. She dangled there all night, and in the morning, when they came to cut the body down, she was still alive.” Webster became known as Half-Hanged Mary. The maiden name of Atwood’s grandmother was Webster, and the family tree can be traced back to John Webster, the fifth governor of Connecticut. “On Monday, my grandmother would say Mary was her ancestor, and on Wednesday she would say she wasn’t,” Atwood said. “So take your pick.”\n\n\n\n\n\nAtwood made the artist’s pick: she chose the story. She once wrote a vivid narrative poem in the voice of Half-Hanged Mary—in Atwood’s telling, a sardonic, independent-minded crone who was targeted by neighbors “for having blue eyes and a sunburned skin . . . a weedy farm in my own name, / and a surefire cure for warts.” Webster’s grim endurance at the end of the rope (“Most will have only one death. / I will have two.”) grants her a perverse kind of freedom. She can now say anything: “The words boil out of me, / coil after coil of sinuous possibility. / The cosmos unravels from my mouth, / all fullness, all vacancy.” In *1985*{: .correct}, Atwood made Webster one of two dedicatees of her best-known novel, “The Handmaid’s Tale,” a dystopian vision of the near future, in which the United States has become a fundamentalist theocracy, and the few women whose fertility has not been compromised by environmental pollution are forced into childbearing. The other dedicatee of “The Handmaid’s Tale” was Perry Miller, the scholar of American intellectual history; Atwood studied under him at Harvard, in the early sixties, extending her knowledge of Puritanism well beyond fireside tales.\n\n\n\nHaving embraced the heritage of Half-Hanged Mary—and having, at seventy-seven, reached an age at which sardonic independent-mindedness is permissible, and even expected—Atwood is winningly game to play the role of the wise elder who might have a spell up her sleeve. In January, I visited her in her home town of Toronto, and within a few hours of our meeting, while having coffee at a crowded café, she performed what friends know as a familiar party trick. After explaining that she had picked up the precepts of medieval palmistry decades ago, from an art-historian neighbor whose specialty was Hieronymus Bosch, Atwood spent several disconcerting minutes poring over my hands. First, she noted my heart line and the line of my intellect, and what their relative positions revealed about my capacity for getting things done. She wiggled my thumbs, a test for stubbornness. She examined my life line—“You’re looking quite healthy at the moment,” she said, to my relief—then told me to shake my hands out and let them fall into a resting position, facing upward. She regarded them thoughtfully. “Well, the Virgin Mary you’re not,” she said, dryly. “But you knew that.”\n\n\n\nAtwood has long been Canada’s most famous writer, and current events have polished the oracular sheen of her reputation. With the election of an American President whose campaign trafficked openly in the deprecation of women—and who, on his first working day in office, signed an executive order withdrawing federal funds from overseas women’s-health organizations that offer abortion services—the novel that Atwood dedicated to Mary Webster has reappeared on best-seller lists. “The Handmaid’s Tale” is also about to be serialized on television, in an adaptation, starring Elisabeth Moss, that will stream on Hulu. The timing could not be more fortuitous, though many people may wish that it were less so. In a photograph taken the day after the Inauguration, at the Women’s March on Washington, a protester held a sign bearing a slogan that spoke to the moment: “*make margaret atwood fiction again*{: .small}.”\n\n\n\nIf the election of Donald Trump were fiction, Atwood maintains, it would be too implausible to satisfy readers. “There are too many wild cards—you want me to believe that the F.B.I. stood up and said _this_, and that the guy over at WikiLeaks did _that_?” she said. “Fiction has to be something that people would actually believe. If you had published it last June, everybody would have said, ‘That is never going to happen.’ ” Atwood is a buoyant doomsayer. Like a skilled doctor, she takes evident satisfaction in providing an accurate diagnosis, even when the cultural prognosis is bleak. She attended the Toronto iteration of the Women’s March, wearing a wide-brimmed floppy hat the color of Pepto-Bismol: not so much a pussy hat as the chapeau of a lioness. Among the signs she saw that day, her favorite was one held by a woman close to her own age; it said, “*i can’t believe i’m still holding this fucking sign*{: .small}.” Atwood remarked, “After sixty years, why are we doing this again? But, as you know, in any area of life, it’s push and pushback. We have had the pushback, and now we are going to have the push again.”\n\n\n\nUnlike many writers, Atwood does not require a particular desk, arranged in a particular way, before she can work. “There’s a good and a bad side to that,” she told me. “If I did have those things, then I would be able to put myself in that fetishistic situation, and the writing would flow into me, because of the magical objects. But I don’t have those, so that doesn’t happen.” The good side is that she can write anywhere, and does so, prolifically. She is equally uninhibited about genre. Atwood’s bibliography runs to about sixty books—novels, poetry, short-story collections, works of criticism, children’s books, and, most recently, a comic-book series about a part-feline, part-avian, part-human superhero called Angel Catbird. She is offhanded about her versatility. “I always wrote more than one type of thing,” she said. “Nobody told me not to.” On one occasion, over tea, she showed me her left hand: it had writing on it. “When all else fails, you do have a surface you can write on,” she said.\n\n\n\nAtwood travels frequently, and has often spent months at a time living in foreign countries, sometimes under conditions that a less flexible artist might find impossibly distracting. She started writing “The Handmaid’s Tale” on a clunky rented typewriter while on a fellowship in West Berlin, in 1984. (Orwell was on her mind.) She spent a winter in the remote English village of Blakeney, in Norfolk, where her only means of calling North America was a telephone kiosk that was usually used for storing potatoes, and where the stone-floored cottage in which she wrote was so cold that she developed chilblains on her toes. When her daughter, Jess, who was born in 1976, was eighteen months old, Atwood and her partner, the novelist Graeme Gibson, made a round-the-world trip. After winding through Europe, they visited Afghanistan—a keen student of military history, Atwood wanted to see the terrain where the British had been defeated—as well as India and Singapore. They proceeded to Australia, for the Adelaide Literary Festival, then returned to Canada, via Fiji and Hawaii. They made do with carry-on luggage the whole way. ^^\n\n\n\nHome is a mansion in the Annex neighborhood of Toronto, near the university. She and Gibson have lived there for more than thirty years, and a basement office serves as the headquarters of Atwood’s company, O. W. Toad, Ltd. (The whimsical name is an anagram of “Atwood,” but sometimes there are postal inquiries as to the existence of a Mr. Toad.) Atwood does not drive, and, for exercise as well as for efficiency, she likes to walk around her neighborhood; she often encounters en route some friend of a half-century’s standing, and they will stop and discuss the past and future surgeries of loved ones—the inevitable discourse of the septuagenarian. Sometimes she drags a heavy shopping cart, loaded with books, for donation to the local library. \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/593b68f357b86d47b169cb8b]||||||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nAtwood is enormously well read, and is an evangelist for books she admires, especially by young writers. When I was visiting, she pressed into my hands “Stay with Me,” a novel by the twenty-nine-year-old Nigerian writer Ayobami Adebayo. Sarah Polley, the Canadian film director and writer, who is a friend of Atwood’s, told me, “Usually, after seeing her, I come home with a full notebook, half in her handwriting and half in mine, of every movie and book I had heard of while talking to her—a full course load.” Polley recently wrote the script for a six-part Netflix adaptation of Atwood’s 1996 novel, “Alias Grace,” which is based on a true-life murder mystery in nineteenth-century rural Canada. The book earned Atwood her third of five Booker Prize nominations.\n\n\n\nAtwood is warmly recognized in Toronto, whether she is on the street, in a restaurant, or in the subway. (She once slipped me one of her senior-citizen tickets, with a sly arch of the eyebrow.) Traffic cops nod to her in crosswalks, and every encounter I had with her was interrupted by a supplicant autograph hunter or selfie seeker. She never declined. “In the age of social media, you cannot say no, because you’ll get ‘Mean Margaret Atwood was rude to me in a restaurant,’ ” she told me one lunchtime, after graciously signing yet another young woman’s notebook. (Atwood speaks in a low, ironical monotone but adopts a querulous squeak when impersonating imagined detractors.) She would look striking even if she were not familiar. She owns an array of brightly colored winter coats—jewel red, imperial purple—with faux-fur-trimmed hoods that frame her face, as do her abundant curls of silver hair. She has high cheekbones and an aquiline nose, the kind of features that age has a hard time withering. Her skin is clear and translucent, of the sort that writers of popular Victorian fiction associated with good moral character.\n\n\n\nOne morning, I accompanied her to the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library, at the University of Toronto, where she has donated her archive: four hundred and seventy-four boxes’ worth of papers, so far. She had requested in advance to see materials related to “The Handmaid’s Tale,” and a small study room had been reserved for our use. Boxes had been rolled in on a cart, and one of them contained Atwood’s handwritten draft. On an early page, she describes the plain contours of the room in which Offred, the novel’s narrator, lives—“A chair, a table, a lamp”—though Atwood had not yet refined the detail that, in the published version, gives the opening paragraph of the second chapter a menacing power: “There must have been a chandelier, once. They’ve removed anything you could tie a rope to.” Another box was labelled “Handmaid’s Tale: Background,” and Atwood pried the box open to reveal files containing sheaves of newspaper clippings from the mid-eighties.\n\n\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n\n[#gallery: /galleries/592575fd398770218a0cd42e]|||\n__Slide Show__: Drafts and newspaper clippings related to “The Handmaid’s Tale,” from the Margaret Atwood Papers, at the University of Toronto. \n|||\n\n\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\n“Clip-clippety-clip, out of the newspaper I clipped things,” she said, as we looked through the cuttings. There were stories of abortion and contraception being outlawed in Romania, and reports from Canada lamenting its falling birth rate, and articles from the U.S. about Republican attempts to withhold federal funding from clinics that provided abortion services. There were reports about the threat to privacy posed by debit cards, which were a novelty at the time, and accounts of U.S. congressional hearings devoted to the regulation of toxic industrial emissions, in the wake of the deadly gas leak in Bhopal, India. An Associated Press item reported on a Catholic congregation in New Jersey being taken over by a fundamentalist sect in which wives were called “handmaidens”—a word that Atwood had underlined.\n\n\n\nIn writing “The Handmaid’s Tale,” Atwood was scrupulous about including nothing that did not have a historical antecedent or a modern point of comparison. (She prefers that her future-fantasy books be labelled “speculative fiction” rather than “science fiction.” “Not because I don’t like Martians . . . they just don’t fall within my skill set,” she wrote in the introduction to “In Other Worlds: SF and the Human Imagination,” an essay collection that she published in 2011.) The ritualized procreation in the novel—effectively, state-sanctioned rape—is extrapolated from the Bible. “ ‘Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her,’ ” Atwood recited. “Obviously, they stuck the two together and out came the baby, and it was given to Rachel. No kidding. It is right there in the text.” In Atwood’s book, the Handmaids are cultivated, like livestock. “I’m taken to the doctor’s once a month, for tests: urine, hormones, cancer smear, blood test,” Offred recounts. “The same as before, except that now it’s obligatory.” Only after completing several chapters does the reader queasily realize that Offred’s innocuous-sounding name is a designation of ownership: the Commander in whose household the narrator serves is named Fred. A decade ago, the book was banned from high schools in *San Antonio*{: .correct}, Texas, on the ground that it was anti-Christian and excessively explicit about sex. In an open letter to the school district, Atwood pointed out that the Bible has a good deal more to say about sex than her book does, and defended her fiction’s essential truthfulness, speculative or not. “If you see a person heading toward a huge hole in the ground, is it not a friendly act to warn him?” she wrote.\n\n\n\nWith the novel, she intended not just to pose the essential question of dystopian fiction—“Could it happen here?”—but also to suggest ways that it had already happened, here or elsewhere. While living in West Berlin, Atwood visited Poland, where martial law had only recently been lifted; many dissidents were still in jail. She already knew members of the Polish resistance from the Second World War, who had gone into exile in Canada. “I remember one person saying a very telling thing: ‘Pray you will never have occasion to be a hero,’ ” she said. Atwood’s longtime literary agent, Phoebe Larmore, told me of seeing Atwood during the writing of “The Handmaid’s Tale.” “I had been quite ill that year, and Margaret came and sat on my sofa, and I think she looked worse than I did,” Larmore recalled. “I asked her what was happening. She said, ‘It’s the new novel. It scares me. But I have to write it.’ ”\n\n\n\n“The Handmaid’s Tale” became a best-seller, despite some sniffy reviews, like one in the _Times_, by Mary McCarthy, who wrote, “Even when I try, in the light of these palely lurid pages, to take the Moral Majority seriously, no shiver of recognition ensues.” It has since sold so many millions of copies that Atwood considers them uncountable. Her friend the novelist Valerie Martin was the first to read the finished manuscript; they were both teaching in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. “There is kind of a disagreement about what I said,” Martin told me. “_She_ says that I said, ‘There is something in it.’ But what _I_ think I said is: ‘You are going to be rich.’ ” The book quickly became canonical. Atwood’s daughter was nine when it was published; by the time she was in high school, it was required reading for graduation.\n\n\n\nDespite the novel’s current air of timeliness, the contours of the dystopian future that Atwood imagined in the eighties do not map closely onto the present moment—although recent news images of asylum seekers fleeing across the U.S. border into Canada have a chilling resonance with the opening moments of the television series, which shows Moss, not yet enlisted as a Handmaid, attempting to escape from the U.S. to its northern neighbor, where democracy prevails. Still, the U.S. in 2017 does not show immediate signs of becoming Gilead, Atwood’s imagined theocratic American republic. President Trump is not an adherent of traditional family values; he is a serial divorcer. He is not known to be a man of religious faith; his Sundays are spent on the golf course.\n\n\n\nWhat does feel familiar in “The Handmaid’s Tale” is the blunt misogyny of the society that Atwood portrays, and which Trump’s vocal repudiation of “political correctness” has loosed into common parlance today. Trump’s vilification of Hillary Clinton, Atwood believes, is more explicable when seen through the lens of the Puritan witch-hunts. “You can find Web sites that say Hillary was actually a Satanist with demonic powers,” she said. “It is so seventeenth-century that you can hardly believe it. It’s right out of the subconscious—just lying there, waiting to be applied to people.” The legacy of witch-hunting, and the sense of shame that it engendered, Atwood suggests, is an enduring American blight. “Only one of the judges ever apologized for the witch trials, and only one of the accusers ever apologized,” she said. Whenever tyranny is exercised, Atwood warns, it is wise to ask, “_Cui bono_?” Who profits by it? Even when those who survived the accusations levelled against them were later exonerated, only meagre reparations were made. “One of the keys to America is that your neighbor may be a Communist, a serial killer, or in league with satanic forces,” Atwood said. “You really don’t trust your fellow-citizens very much.” \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/593b68f6f60db474ba953e4b]||||||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nNow, Atwood argues, women have been put on notice that hard-won rights may be only provisional. “It’s the return to patriarchy,” she said, as she paged through the clippings. “Look at his Cabinet!” she said of Trump. “Look at the kind of laws that people have put through in the states. _Absolutely_ they want to overturn Roe v. Wade, and they will have to deal with the consequences if they do. You’re going to have a lot more orphanages, aren’t you? A lot more dead women, a lot more illegal abortions, a lot more families with children in them left without a mother. They want it ‘back to the way it was.’ Well, _that_ is part of the way it was.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nAtwood was born in Ottawa, but she spent formative stretches of her early years in the wilderness—first in northern Quebec, and then north of Lake Superior. Her father, Carl Atwood, was an entomologist, and, until Atwood was almost out of elementary school, the family passed all but the coldest months in virtually complete isolation at insect-research stations; at one point, they lived in a log cabin that her father had helped construct.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer mother, also named Margaret—among her intimates, the novelist goes by Peggy—was a dietitian. In the months in the woods, she secured workbooks from school for Atwood and her brother, Harold, who is three years her senior. “The faster you could do them, the sooner you could go out and play, so I became very rapid and superficial in my execution of those sorts of things,” Atwood said. In inclement weather, the children amused themselves by making comic books and by reading. A favorite book was “Grimms’ Fairy Tales,” which Atwood’s parents bought, by mail order, in 1945. “I don’t remember finding any of them frightening,” she wrote later. “By and large, bad things happened only to bad people, which was reassuring; though children have a bloodthirsty sense of justice, they don’t learn mercy until later.”\n\n\n\nHer father had grown up poor, in rural Nova Scotia. Her mother, whose family was also from Nova Scotia, grew up in slightly better circumstances: Atwood’s maternal grandfather was a country doctor, and an aunt had been the first woman to get a master’s degree in history from the University of Toronto. Atwood’s parents were resilient and curious and devoted to the outdoors, and the Atwood children were encouraged to be the same. They sledded across a still frozen lake at the start of the season, and canoed across it during the summer months. In Atwood’s second novel, “Surfacing,” a psychological thriller threaded with twisted family relations that was published in 1972, she depicted the landscape of her youth with unsentimental, sensual precision: “The water was covered with lily pads, the globular yellow lilies with their thick center snouts pushing up from among them. . . . When the paddles hit bottom on the way across, gas bubbles from decomposing vegetation rose and burst with a stench of rotten eggs or farts.” When Atwood was about ten, her father built a vacation cabin on an unoccupied island in the lake. The family still retreats there in the summer.\n\n\n\nIn 1948, Margaret’s father received an appointment at the University of Toronto. (Three years later, another daughter, Ruth, was born.) Margaret, having been raised as her brother’s peer by an unshrinking mother, was unschooled in the conventions of little-girl society. “In the woods, you wore pants not because it was butch but because if you didn’t wear pants and tuck the tops into your socks you would get blackflies up your legs,” she said. “They make little holes in you, into which they inject an anticoagulant. You don’t feel them when they are doing it, and then you take your clothes off and find out you are covered with blood.” In “Cat’s Eye” (1988), Atwood drew on the experience of being transferred from a navigable wilderness to the more treacherous civilization of prepubescent girls. The book’s narrator, Elaine, explains that she has a classmate who “tells me her hair is honey-blond, that her haircut is called a pageboy, that she has to go to the hairdresser’s every two months to get it done. I haven’t known there are such things as pageboys and hairdressers.”\n\n\n\nAtwood started writing in earnest in high school. Her parents, who lived through the Depression, were encouraging but practical. She told me, “My mother said, caustically, ‘If you are going to be a writer, you had better learn to spell.’ I said, airily, ‘Others will do that for me.’ And they do.” She followed her brother to the University of Toronto. (A neurophysiologist, Harold Atwood is a professor emeritus in the department of physiology.) Atwood enrolled in the philosophy department, but after discovering that logical positivism was its mainstay, rather than ethics and aesthetics, she switched to literature.\n\n\n\nThe university’s literature curriculum was unapologetically British: she started with “Beowulf” and took it from there. Canadian literature had yet to be considered worthy of study. A decade later, in 1972, Atwood made a contribution to its establishment as a proper field, with her lucid survey “Survival: A Thematic Guide to Canadian Literature.” In that book, which made her a household name in Canada, she persuasively posited that, whereas the controlling idea of English literature is the island, and the pervasive symbol of American literature is the frontier, the dominant theme in Canadian literature is survival: “Our stories are likely to be tales not of those who made it but of those who made it back from the awful experience—the North, the snowstorm, the sinking ship—that killed everyone else.”\n\n\n\nAs an undergraduate, she audited Northrop Frye’s celebrated course on the Bible and literature. Frye helped her secure a fellowship at Harvard, where, in the sixties, she began to write a doctoral thesis on what she called the “English Metaphysical Romance”—the gothic fantasy novels of the nineteenth century. She never finished it. Atwood had embarked on an academic career not for the love of teaching or scholarship but because making a living as a writer seemed an implausible aspiration. “It was thought presumptuous—this is way before the age of creative-writing programs, and writers, to be serious, ought to be dead,” she recalled.\n\n\n\nAtwood started her career as a poet. Her first professionally published collection, “The Circle Game,” won the Governor General’s Award in 1966, and has never been out of print. The poems, which take the ring-around-the-rosy children’s game as a starting point for an exploration of male-female relationships, show Atwood’s early aptitude for the unflinching, visceral metaphor. A lover examines the speaker’s face “indifferently / yet with the same taut curiosity / with which you might regard / a suddenly discovered part / of your own body: / a wart perhaps.” Atwood’s first novel, “The Edible Woman,” which was written in 1964 and published five years later, is a contemporary satire in which a young woman, having just become engaged—her husband-to-be is clearly the wrong guy—finds herself unable to eat.\n\n\n\nSome reviewers hailed Atwood’s work as a voice of the burgeoning feminist movement. (A reviewer in _Time_ said that the novel had “the kick of a perfume bottle converted into a Molotov cocktail.”) She resisted the identification. “I was not in New York, where all of that kicked off, in 1969,” she said. “I was in Edmonton, Alberta, where there was no feminist movement, and would not be for quite some time.” Atwood was then married to Jim Polk, who had been a classmate at Harvard, and whose teaching job had taken them to the Canadian Northwest. (They divorced in 1973.) “I had people interviewing me who would say, ‘How do you get the housework done?’ I would say, ‘Look under the sofa, then we can talk.’ ”\n\n\n\nIn the sometimes divisive years of second-wave feminism, Atwood reserved the right to remain nonaligned. “I didn’t want to become a megaphone for any one particular set of beliefs,” she said. “Having gone through that initial phase of feminism when you weren’t supposed to wear frocks and lipstick—I never had any use for that. You should be able to wear them without people saying you are a traitor to your sex.” In a 1976 essay, “On Being a ‘Woman Writer’: Paradoxes and Dilemmas,” Atwood described the mixed feelings experienced by women writers old enough to have forged a writing life before representatives of the women’s movement came along to claim them. “It’s not finally all that comforting to have a phalanx of women . . . come breezing up now to tell them they were right all along,” she wrote. “It’s like being judged innocent after you’ve been hanged: the satisfaction, if any, is grim.” \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/593b68f45d2f45736c34d20c]||||||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nGiven that her works are a mainstay of women’s-studies curricula, and that she is clearly committed to women’s rights, Atwood’s resistance to a straightforward association with feminism can come as a surprise. But this wariness reflects her bent toward precision, and a scientific sensibility that was ingrained from childhood: Atwood wants the terms defined before she will state her position. Her feminism assumes women’s rights to be human rights, and is born of having been raised with a presumption of absolute equality between the sexes. “My problem was not that people wanted me to wear frilly pink dresses—it was that _I_ wanted to wear frilly pink dresses, and my mother, being as she was, didn’t see any reason for that,” she said. Atwood’s early years in the forest endowed her with a sense of self-determination, and with a critical distance on codes of femininity—an ability to see those codes as cultural practices worthy of investigation, not as necessary conditions to be accepted unthinkingly. This capacity for quizzical scrutiny underlies much of her fiction: not accepting the world as it is permits Atwood to imagine the world as it might be.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nAtwood and Gibson, who met in Toronto publishing circles, spent the seventies living on a farm outside the city. The countryside was cheap, and it provided a congenial environment for Gibson’s two teen-age sons; it also provides the setting for what Atwood acknowledges as some of her most autobiographical writing, in the short-story collection “Moral Disorder” (2006). The title story details the less picturesque aspects of country life. “Susan the cow went away in a truck one day and came back frozen and dismembered,” Atwood writes. “It was like a magic trick—a woman sawed in half on the stage in plain view of all, to reappear fully restored to wholeness, walking down the aisle; except that Susan’s transformation had gone the other way.”\n\n\n\n\n\nAtwood resists critics’ attempts to find parallels between her life story and her fiction, and has no desire to write a memoir. “I am interested in reading other people’s, if they have had fascinating or gruesome lives, but I don’t think my life has been that fascinating or gruesome,” she said. “The parts of writers’ lives that are interesting are usually the part _before_ they become a well-known writer.” In the mid-eighties, shortly before she started to write “The Handmaid’s Tale” but was already Canada’s most celebrated novelist, a documentary filmmaker named Michael Rubbo spent several days with Atwood and her family at their island retreat in northern Quebec. Rubbo sought to locate the source of Atwood’s inspiration and to uncover the origins of her often gloomy themes, but most of his film is devoted to showing the ways that Atwood politely declined to conform to her inquisitor’s thesis. “I use settings, but that is not to be confused with using real people, and things that have actually happened to those real people,” she tells the filmmaker, while his camera lingers on her hands: she is slicing through the blood-red stalks of rhubarb plants with a chef’s knife and casually discarding the poisonous leaves.\n\n\n\nAt one point, the Atwoods are given control of the camera, and conduct a strange pantomime in which Atwood sits with a brown paper bag over her head while other family members offer sentence-long characterizations of her. “That woman is my daughter, and she’s incognito,” Atwood’s mother says, in the most illuminating of the remarks. Atwood, after removing the bag, says, “Michael Rubbo’s whole problem is that he thinks of me as mysterious and a problem to be solved. . . . He’s trying to find out why some of my work is sombre in tone, shall we say, and he’s trying for some simple explanation of that in me or in my life, rather than in the society that I am portraying.” At another moment, she suggests that her novels should be thought of as being in the tradition of the Victorian realist or social novel, and should be read in the light of objective facts, rather than subjective experience.\n\n\n\nSome of her most perceptive readers have taken this approach. The novelist Francine Prose, reviewing “Alias Grace,” noted that “Atwood has always had much in common with those writers of the last century who were engaged less by the subtle minutiae of human interaction than by the chance to use fiction as a means of exploring and dramatizing ideas.” At its best, Atwood’s fiction summons an intricate social world, whether it be a disquieting vision of the future, as in “The Handmaid’s Tale,” or a vividly rendered past, as in “Alias Grace” or “The Blind Assassin”—a genre-bending tour de force set partly in small-town Canada in the nineteen-twenties, for which Atwood won the Booker Prize, in 2000.\n\n\n\nLike her Victorian forebears, Atwood does not shy away from the idea that the novel is a place to explore questions of morality. In an e-mail, she wrote to me, “You can’t use language and avoid moral dimensions, since words are so weighted (lilies that fester vs. weeds, etc.) and all characters have to live somewhere, even if they are rabbits, as in ‘Watership Down,’ and they have to live at some time . . . and they have to make choices.” The challenge, she noted, is avoiding moralism: “How do you ‘engage’ without preaching too much and reducing the characters to mere allegories? A perennial problem. But when the large social issues are very large indeed (‘Doctor Zhivago’), the characters will act within—and be acted upon by—everything that surrounds them.”\n\n\n\nAt the same time, Atwood’s best fiction is sustained by a specificity of detail—a capacity for noticing—that might be expected from one whose scientist father introduced her to a microscope at a young age. One morning, while we were walking in her neighborhood, Atwood bumped into an old friend, Adrienne Clarkson, a college contemporary who went on to have a distinguished career as a broadcaster, and, for six years, as the governor general of Canada. “We are going to crawl into our eighties together,” Clarkson said, inviting us to her home for tea. The women reminisced about studying with Northrop Frye. “He is the person who talked me into going to grad school instead of moving to Paris, and living in a garret and drinking absinthe,” Atwood said. “But, Adrienne, you _did_ move to Paris.”\n\n\n\n“You came to visit,” Clarkson said.\n\n\n\n“And you were painting your fingernails a beautiful shade of red,” Atwood continued.\n\n\n\n“How frivolous of you to remember that,” Clarkson said, fondly.\n\n\n\n“How _novelistic_ of me to remember it,” Atwood said.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nNot long ago, a history society at the University of Toronto, which was compiling a video archive of notable alumni, asked to interview Atwood about her college days. On a chilly afternoon in January, she found her way to an upper room in the university’s Gothic Revival student center. Four eager undergraduates, all women, were there to film and quiz her. Atwood sat by a leaded-glass window against a gray sky, and amiably answered questions about what it was like being a young woman on campus in the fifties. “Whatever things are like when you are young, they seem normal, because you have nothing to compare them to,” she said. “For instance, I would not ever have worn jeans to high school. It would not have been permitted except on football days. They wanted us to wear jeans on football day, so we could sit on the hill and not have anyone looking up our skirts. It takes a while to figure this out, but now I realize that must have been the reason.”\n\n\n\n\n\nIn those days, Atwood said, there was no fear of rape on campus, as there seemed to be today. “I am not saying that it didn’t happen, but you would never hear of it,” she said. “And I would suspect that the chances of that happening were quite low, because what everybody was afraid of then was getting pregnant. The boys were afraid of getting pregnant, too, because you could end up married at an early age that way, and people didn’t particularly want that. But there was no Pill.”\n\n\n\nOne young interviewer, wide-eyed, said, “It is very interesting to consider the importance of the Pill, not just for women but in changing society. I hadn’t really considered it.”\n\n\n\nAtwood continued talking about changing mores—the supplanting of the panty girdle by nylon tights, and the consequent innovation of the miniskirt. But when one of the students fumbled with the camera, in an effort to renew its memory card, Atwood took the opportunity to turn the tables.\n\n\n\n“I was astonished to see that the Polaroid camera has come back—_why_? What do you do with a Polaroid picture?” she asked.\n\n\n\nThe students, delighted, offered a chorus of explanations: such images combined the instant gratification of the selfie with the pleasure of a physical object that could be pinned on a wall. Atwood went on to seek their views on other surprisingly resurgent technologies—vinyl records, even cassette players—and then shifted to something more up-to-date. “Do you know an exercise app called Zombies, Run?” she asked.\n\n\n\n“Is that, like, where you go for a run and zombies chase you?” one student asked. Yes, Atwood said: the app, a kind of interactive podcast, plays an apocalyptic story line in a listener’s ears as she jogs, thus making a workout more entertaining, if you like that sort of thing. “I’m in one of the episodes,” Atwood announced. She has a cameo as herself: her voice is supposedly being transmitted over a crackling phone line from Toronto. \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/593b68f81f743c6ee49a579a]||||||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nFinally, the students’ camera was working. Atwood faced it again, and said, brightly, “So, let’s see. What else do you want to know?”\n\n\n\nHer openness to younger people is, in part, a consequence of the passage of time: there are many more younger people around than older ones, so she’d better be open to them, if she’s going to be open to anybody. But it is also temperamental. Zombies, Run! was co-created by Naomi Alderman, a British novelist in her early forties, who is also a video-game designer. She and Atwood became friends after Atwood chose to be her mentor, through a program sponsored by Rolex. “She was intrigued that I might know about something she doesn’t know about yet, and I might be able to tell her about it,” Alderman said. “I don’t think she judges anything in advance as being beneath her, or beyond her, or outside her realm of interest.” Alderman has accompanied Atwood and Gibson on several bird-watching vacations, including one earlier this year in the rain forests of Panama. “We stayed in tents,” Alderman told me. “And the first night I was going back to my tent and my headlamp caught these blue shining glints on the jungle floor, and every single one of these glints was a pair of spider’s eyes staring at me. When I told Margaret, she was very disappointed—she really wanted to see the spiders.”\n\n\n\nAtwood’s embrace of technological innovation is sometimes more theoretical than practical: she has yet to master streaming video, so she still watches DVDs. Occasionally, her fascination with technological processes, combined with an incomprehension of them, can have productive results. A dozen or so years ago, when videoconferencing technology was still a novelty, Atwood wondered whether it might be possible to develop a means of conducting book signings remotely. “I thought of the writing flying through the air, and materializing somewhere else,” she said. Her flight of fancy, combined with some technical and marketing know-how assembled by Matthew Gibson, her stepson, resulted in the LongPen, a robotic device that enables a writer—or anyone—to sign a paper remotely in a manner that replicates the speed and pressure of the original autograph, and is indistinguishable from it. (Gibson has since created an e-signature company, Syngrafii, and it sells the LongPen, which is marketed less to weary authors than to financial and legal companies.)\n\n\n\nAtwood was an early adopter of Twitter, signing up in 2009; she now has about a million and a half followers, though she is aware that some of that number must be bots. “I do sometimes get ‘I miss your dick’—they don’t read the fine print,” she said. She appreciates followers who have a specialized interest in the sciences; they help her keep abreast of recent developments that might be of interest for a future writing project, or resonate with a past one. She engages, often cheerily, with her followers and others, sometimes on topics that another writer might avoid. “Only ‘race’ is the human race, sez me. (And says science.),” she wrote in response to one user’s speculation that she was Jewish. “But no, I wouldn’t have ended up in a Hitler death camp for that reason.”\n\n\n\nFor years, Atwood has argued that Twitter in particular and the Internet in general have been good for literacy. “People have to actually be able to read and write to use the Internet, so it’s a great literacy driver, if kids are given the tools and the incentive to learn the skills that allow them to access it,” she said, while being interviewed at a digital-media conference in 2011. She has been a champion of Wattpad, a story-sharing site founded in Toronto a decade ago. In her view, it not only provides a place for North American teen-agers to publish their own zombie tales; it also offers cell-phone-equipped readers in the developing world with an entry point into fiction, even if they have no access to libraries, schools, or books. Her 2015 novel, “The Heart Goes Last,” which takes the premise of for-profit prisons to monstrous, comic ends, was excerpted on Wattpad. Atwood has also published a collection of poems, “Thriller Suite,” serially, on Wattpad; the book has been viewed more than three hundred and eighty thousand times since then, presumably reaching many readers who had never bought a volume of poetry.\n\n\n\nShe believes that early fears, among some observers, that the advent of the Web would mean the end of books were misplaced. “I think we know now that, neurologically, there are reasons why that isn’t going to happen,” Atwood said. “Installments on a phone—those, the brain can handle. ‘War and Peace,’ maybe not. Though ‘War and Peace’ was first published in installments, by the way.” She is fond of saying that, with all technology, there is a good side, a bad side, and a stupid side that you weren’t expecting. “Look at an axe—you can cut a tree down with it, and you can murder your neighbor with it,” she said. “And the stupid side you hadn’t considered is that you can accidentally cut your foot off with it.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nA few years ago, Atwood became the first author to participate in a conceptual art project, the Future Library, which was conceived by a Scottish artist named Katie Paterson. In the course of a hundred years, a hundred writers will contribute a manuscript to the project. The manuscripts will remain unread except for their titles—Atwood’s is “Scribbler Moon”—until 2114, when they will be printed on paper made from a thousand pine trees that have been planted in the Nordmarka, a forest not far from where the library will be maintained, in Oslo, Norway.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Being the kind of child who buried things in the back yard in jars, hoping that someone else would dig them up sometime, I of course liked this project,” she told me. Atwood has a keen interest in conservation: she uses her Twitter feed to highlight ecological issues ranging from the decimation of the bee population to ocean pollution. The optimism inherent in the Future Library—the belief that there will be readers, and a world for them to inhabit—seems at odds with some of the darker scenarios in Atwood’s fiction, and I suggested as much to her.\n\n\n\n“This is not a question of _expect_,” she said. “It is a question of hope. It is a question of faith rather than knowledge. You wouldn’t do it unless you thought there was a chance.” Humans, she said, “have hope built in,” adding, “If our ancestors had not had that component, they would not have bothered getting up in the morning. You are always going to have hope that today there will be a giraffe, where yesterday there wasn’t one.” At the same time, Atwood loves to entertain notions of how degraded our future might become, and what effect that might have on the human race. She speculates that, if our atmosphere becomes too carbon-heavy, with a dwindling in the oxygen supply, one of the first things that will happen is that we will become a lot less intelligent.\n\n\n\nBut a novelist necessarily imagines the fate of individuals; the human condition is what the novel was made for exploring. “We just actually can’t bear the idea of nothing,” Atwood said. “I think that is partly to do with grammar. You say, ‘I will be dead,’ but there is still an ‘I.’ There is still a subject.” Her novels, she went on, are not without hope, either. “The Handmaid’s Tale” has a coda, in the form of an address given, in 2195, by a keynote speaker at an academic conference, the Twelfth Symposium on Gileadean Studies. Civilization has survived, even to the point of sustaining groaningly bad academic puns. (Women fleeing Gilead, a professor notes, cross the border via “The Underground Frailroad.”) “I have never done everybody in,” Atwood said. “I have never polished them all off so that there’s nobody left alive, now, have I? _No._”\n\n\n\nIn the early aughts, she began an ambitious cycle of novels exploring a different kind of dystopian future. The Maddaddam Trilogy—“Oryx and Crake,” “The Year of the Flood,” and “Maddaddam”—was published between 2003 and 2013. The books depict a North American landscape that is ravaged by ecological disaster and inhabited by a genetically modified race of quasi-humans, the Crakers. As usual, Atwood researched her subject voraciously, and this time she was further enabled by the Internet. The trilogy crackles with a gleeful inventiveness that is sometimes tonally at odds with its apocalyptic content: the Crakers’ skin cells have been modified to repel ultraviolet rays and mosquitoes, for example, and the capacity for sexual jealousy has been edited out of their genome. \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/593b68fa1f743c6ee49a579c]||||||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nOne evening in Toronto, Atwood invited me to her home, where we sat in its spacious kitchen on tall stools at a counter, overlooking her wintry, barren-looking garden. Graeme Gibson poured three glasses of whiskey while Atwood sorted through Christmas cards, dispensing with the chore as efficiently as if she were slicing rhubarb. I remarked on an aspect of “Oryx and Crake” that had moved me. The protagonist, Snowman, apparently left alone in the world, strives to remember unusual words he once knew. Atwood writes, “_Valance. Norn. Serendipity. Pibroch. Lubricious._ When they’ve gone out of his head, these words, they’ll be gone, everywhere, forever. As if they had never been.” Reading this passage in recent months led me to think about the catastrophic devaluation of intellection that seems to have occurred in American society: the willful repudiation of rigorous thinking, and objective facts, that helped propel Trump to victory. I remarked to Atwood that it felt like a prescient metaphor.\n\n\n\n“It feels like real life,” Atwood replied, quickly. “I am sure every generation feels that way, as they see younger people coming up who don’t know _what_ they are talking about.” She asked if I knew Edith Wharton’s short story “After Holbein”: “This old gentleman in New York society goes off to visit this hostess of his youth, and they sit at this enormous table, and everything is as wonderful as he remembers it, and there are bouquets of flowers, and this delicious food, and they have this wonderful conversation and she looks as beautiful as ever. And you see it all from the point of view of the servants, and it’s two old people sitting at a table eating gruel, and the flowers are all bunches of newspaper.”\n\n\n\nNews comes often to Atwood of friends who have died, or are ailing. Gibson has been given a diagnosis of early dementia, and they are both supporters of the Canadian dying-with-dignity movement. “The story of Wharton’s that really terrifies me is ‘The Pelican,’ ” she went on, recalling a tale in which a well-born widow takes to giving public lectures to support her young son, and then continues to give them for decades, even after the son is a grown man. “People are very sympathetic, but the lecture itself is like watching someone unreeling from her mouth a very long spool of blank paper,” Atwood said. “That’s the metaphor that frightens me—that I am going to be up in public, unravelling from my mouth a long spool of blank paper.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nIn March, Atwood came to New York City, for the annual National Book Critics Circle award ceremony, where she was being given a lifetime-achievement award. (Atwood recently remarked, on an Ask Me Anything thread on Reddit, that she is at the “Gold Watch and Goodbye” phase of her career.) The ceremony was held at the New School, and the collective mood of the assembled editors, critics, and writers—a concentration of New York’s liberal intelligentsia in its purest form—was celebratory, as such events always are, but also agitated and galvanized. That morning, President Trump had issued his first federal budget plan, and he had proposed eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, as well as ending funding for public broadcasting, and closing agencies devoted to social welfare and environmental oversight. The crowd felt like bruised defenders of a civilization that they hadn’t realized was susceptible to attack.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump’s agenda was criticized by many of the award recipients. Michelle Dean, a young Canadian writer who won the association’s annual prize for excellence in reviewing, declared, “The struggle we presently find ourselves in is not a mistake, and not a fluke. . . . It crept into our lives while we were napping. Power sometimes works that way, but I still wish we hadn’t missed it.” Lately, Dean added, she’d been rereading “The Handmaid’s Tale” for the first time since high school: “There are so few books like that being published right now. The application of literary intelligence to this question of power—it’s kind of out of style. And many writers just seem more interested in exploring the self.”\n\n\n\nTwo days before Trump’s Inauguration, Atwood had published an essay in _The Nation,_ in which she questioned the generalities sometimes made by left-leaning intellectuals about the role of the artist in public life. “Artists are always being lectured on their moral duty, a fate other professionals—dentists, for example—generally avoid,” she observed. “There’s nothing inherently sacred about films and pictures and writers and books. ‘Mein Kampf’ was a book.” In fact, she said, writers and other artists are particularly prone to capitulating to authoritarian pressure; the isolation inherent in the craft makes them psychologically vulnerable. “The pen is mightier than the sword, but only in retrospect,” she wrote. “At the time of combat, those with the swords generally win.”\n\n\n\nAt the New School, when Atwood, wearing a long black dress with a patterned black shawl draped around her shoulders, was summoned to the stage, she took a cheekier tack than she had taken in the _Nation_ essay. “I’m very, very, very happy to be here, because they let me across the border,” she said, her voice low and deliberate. Atwood characterized literary criticism as a thankless task. “Authors are sensitive beings,” she observed, to titters of amusement. “You, therefore, know that all positive adjectives applied to them will be forgotten, yet anything even faintly smacking of imperfection in their work will rankle until the end of time.” An author whom she had reviewed once berated her use of the adjective “accomplished,” she recalled. “ ‘Don’t you know that “accomplished” is an insult?’ ” she deadpanned. “I didn’t know.”\n\n\n\nThen her remarks took an exhortatory turn. “Why do I do such a painful task?” she said. “For the same reason I give blood. We must all do our part, because if nobody contributes to this worthy enterprise then there won’t be any, just when it’s most needed.” Now is one of those times, she warned: “Never has American democracy felt so challenged.” The necessary conditions for dictatorship, Atwood noted, include the shutting down of independent media, which mutes the expression of contrary or subversive opinions; writers form part of the fragile barrier standing between authoritarian control and open democracy. “There are still places on this planet where to be caught reading you, or even me, would incur a severe penalty,” Atwood said. “I hope there will soon be fewer such places.” Her voice dropped to a stage whisper: “I am not holding my breath.”\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, she thanked the book critics, though even her gratitude carried a note of subversion. “I will cherish this lifetime-achievement award from you, though, like all sublunar blessings, it is a mixed one,” she said. “Why do I only get one lifetime? Where did this lifetime go?” ♦\n\n\n\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the city in Texas where “The Handmaid’s Tale” was banned.

The TV adaptation of the book would soon begin streaming, on Hulu. The show stars Elisabeth Moss as the novel’s narrator and protagonist, Offred, a woman stripped of her job, her family, and her name in a near-future American theocracy called Gilead. Offred is a Handmaid, forced to live as a breeding concubine; each month, she is ceremonially raped by her Commander, a man of high status, in the interest of rebuilding a population that has dwindled owing to secular immorality, environmental toxicity, and super-S.T.D.s. Like all Handmaids, she wears a scarlet dress, a long cloak, and a face-obscuring white bonnet, a uniform that Atwood based, in part, on the woman on the label of Old Dutch Cleanser, an image that had scared her as a child.\n\nWomen wore this uniform to the protest in Texas, and they have since worn it to protests in England, Ireland, Argentina, Croatia, and elsewhere. When “The Handmaid’s Tale” was published, in 1985, some reviewers found Atwood’s dystopia to be poetically rich but implausible. Three decades later, the book is most often described with reference to its timeliness. The current President has bragged about grabbing women “by the pussy,” and the Vice-President is a man who, as governor of Indiana, signed a law that required fetal remains of miscarriages and abortions, at any stage of pregnancy, to be cremated or buried. This year, half a dozen states have passed legislation banning abortion after around six weeks; Alabama passed a law that would ban abortion in nearly all circumstances, including cases involving rape or incest. (All these laws have yet to take effect.)\n\nAt first, I found it moving to see women at protests in Handmaid garb. Sometimes they carried signs with the dog-Latin phrase “_Nolite te bastardes carborundorum_,” which, in Atwood’s novel, is scribbled in Offred’s closet, a message from a previous Handmaid: Don’t let the bastards grind you down. The costumes could be read as an expression of inter-class solidarity: women with the time and the resources to protest tend not to be those who suffer first when reproductive rights are restricted, but the former were saying, on behalf of the latter, that they would fight for us all.\n\nOnly a portion of the women in Gilead are Handmaids; others are Marthas, who cook and clean, or Aunts, who indoctrinate other women into the life style of subjugation, or Wives, obedient trophies who smile graciously while other women do all the work. But the novel confines you within Offred’s perspective—it suggests, even demands, identification with the Handmaids. The TV show, with its lush cinematography and its sumptuous art direction and its decision to have Moss say things like “Nolite te bastardes carborundorum, _bitches_,” turned this suggestion, perhaps inevitably, into a marketing angle: we are all Handmaids. It has reinvented the subdued Offred of the novel as the destructive, mesmerizing, apparently unbreakable June. (That’s the name Offred had before Gilead—though, in Atwood’s original conception, Offred’s real name had disappeared.)\n\nAs the show became popular, and the iconography spread, its meaning became diffuse. The Handmaid seemed to evolve from a symbol of advocacy for victims into a way of playacting victimhood. Women were buying red cloaks and white bonnets on Amazon, leaving four- and five-star reviews with tongue-in-cheek Gilead greetings. “Blessed be the fruit,” one customer wrote, noting that she “got lots of compliments.” Another review: “Perfect. Can’t wait for Halloween!” M-G-M, which produces the TV adaptation, briefly attempted to sell a line of Handmaid-themed wine. The twenty-two-year-old billionaire cosmetics entrepreneur Kylie Jenner threw a “Handmaid’s Tale”-themed party for her best friend’s birthday. An instinct toward solidarity had been twisted into what seemed like a private fantasy of persecution that could flatten all differences among women—a vision of terrible equality, which, in an era when minute gradations of power are analyzed constantly, could induce a secret thrill.\n\nSometimes I found myself wondering how many of the women indulging this fantasy would, in some future real-life Gilead, become not Handmaids but Wives. This was, it turns out, not only a judgmental thought but a simplistic one. Atwood has now written a sequel, “[The Testaments](https://www.amazon.com/Testaments-Novel-Margaret-Atwood/dp/0385543786)” (Nan A. Talese), set fifteen years after the first book ends. The new novel, like its predecessor, is presented as a story assembled from historical artifacts, with an epilogue that depicts a twenty-second-century academic conference about Gilead. But, in “The Testaments,” Handmaids and Wives hardly enter the picture at all. Instead, it is about the Aunts, and three of them in particular: one whom we already know from the first book, and who, we learn, helped to establish Gilead’s shadow matriarchy, within a thicket of rapists; one who was raised inside Gilead, and who grew up devout and illiterate and expecting to be married by the age of fourteen; and one who is sent to Gilead, as a teen-ager, by the resistance, which is based in Canada, and which carries out reconnaissance missions and helps citizens of Gilead to escape.\n\nThe book may surprise readers who wondered, when the sequel was announced, whether Atwood was making a mistake in returning to her earlier work. She has said that “The Testaments” was inspired by readers’ questions about the inner workings of Gilead, and also by “the world we’ve been living in.” But it seems to have another aim as well: to help us see more clearly the kinds of complicity required for constructing a world like the one she had already imagined, and the world we fear our own might become.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAtwood, who was born in Ottawa in 1939, has been the most famous Canadian author for decades. She published her first book, a collection of poems, in 1961, and has since written, among other things, seventeen novels, sixteen poetry collections, ten works of nonfiction, eight short-story collections, and seven children’s books. As a novelist, she has a wide tonal range, moving from sarcasm to solemnity, austerity to playfulness; she can toggle between extremes of subtlety and unsubtlety from book to book. In her “MaddAddam” trilogy, begun in the early two-thousands and set in a near-future world where overpopulation leads society to reduce everything to its base functionality, Atwood takes aim at technocracy and corporate control: people eat “ChickieNobs,” the product of genetically engineered chickens that consist of a mouth surrounded by twenty breast-meat tubes; the Crakers, a humanoid race designed for a minimum of trouble and a maximum of efficiency, have giant penises that turn blue when the females of the species are in heat. “Cat’s Eye,” on the other hand, which was published in 1988, is a quiet study of the ways that women and girls are gently and devastatingly cruel to one another. I reread it recently, and felt a sensation I associate with reading Atwood: nothing was really happening, but I was riveted, and fearful, as if someone were showing me footage of a car crash one frame at a time.\n\nAtwood’s best novels bring to bear a psychologist’s grasp of deep, interior forces and a mad scientist’s knack for conceptual experiments that can draw these forces out into the open. “The Blind Assassin,” published in 2000, does this: a novel about two sisters growing up in rural Ontario, it contains a novel-within-the-novel, which itself contains another novel, a science-fiction story set on a planet called Zycron. So does “The Handmaid’s Tale,” which had become required reading by the time I bought it for an English class in college. I was acquainted with theocracy, and the sick appeal of female subservience: I had grown up Baptist in Texas, with the idea that girls should consecrate their bodies for God and for their future husbands. At the religious school that I attended for twelve years, we regularly stood and pledged allegiance to the American flag, the Christian flag (white, with a red cross on a blue canton), and the Bible. In this context, Gilead seemed a little effortful: you didn’t need to rename the butcher shop All Flesh and rebrand rape as a supervised monthly ceremony in order to bend a society to someone’s bad idea of God’s will. But, such broad strokes aside, the novel is characterized by remarkable patience and restraint. Coming across the book’s offhand mention that oranges have been scarce “since Central America was lost to the Libertheos,” you can spend twenty pages wondering about Gilead’s import-export structure—and, all the while, the existential diminishment of the utterly ordinary Offred is quietly lighting you on fire.\n\nChristianity and white supremacy are intertwined and foundational ideas in America, and, in the novel, Jews who refuse to convert are shipped off to Israel, while the “Children of Ham” are resettled in the Midwest. The precedent of slavery in the conception of Gilead, which is alluded to in the epilogue of “The Handmaid’s Tale” and acknowledged by Atwood in an introduction to a recent edition, has been consistently underplayed in the book’s reception. In the TV adaptation, in a seeming attempt at deference to contemporary concerns about representation, Gilead is uneasily and halfheartedly post-racial; Moira, June’s best friend, who is also a Handmaid, is played by Samira Wiley, who is black. The show depicts a purity-obsessed society in which the powerful—who are all white in the book, and virtually all white on the show—mostly don’t care about having white children, or maintaining the appearance of “pure” lineage. Atwood is a producer on the show, and she has noted that racial dynamics have changed since she wrote the book. Bruce Miller, the adaptation’s showrunner, has said that he saw little difference between “making a TV show about racism and making a racist TV show.” That’s an odd line to draw, given the series’ willingness—its requirement and mission, really—to be unpleasant. Season 3 features a scene in which June has to patiently persuade her new Commander to rape her. The difference between making a TV show about female punishment and making a TV show that punishes women may also be smaller than Miller thought.\n\nThe adaptation has moved well past where the novel ends. According to Hulu, viewership increased seventy-six per cent between Seasons 1 and 2, and forty per cent between Seasons 2 and 3\\. The show has dragged out Offred’s plight beyond all reason—Season 3 takes place some five years after the rise of Gilead, and Season 4 is in the works—while taking a tremendously long time to provide details about how, precisely, Gilead was established and, later, destabilized. Learning such things is one of the only possible upsides, to my mind, of staying in this world beyond the condensed period required for reading a novel. How was Gilead’s freaky nomenclature decided on? Aren’t Gileadeans worried about incest, since kids rarely know who their real parents are?\n\n“The Testaments” addresses these and other questions in sidelong mentions, which help to make more concrete a world that, in the first novel—partly because of Offred’s fiercely enforced ignorance—felt abstract, like a landscape obscured by fog. (The publisher has emphasized that “The Testaments” is “not connected” to the TV show, though certain plot elements overlap.) We learn that four founding Aunts invented “laws, uniforms, slogans, hymns, names” for Gilead, and allowed the Commanders to take credit. They maintain a genealogical registry that records both the official and unofficial parentage of each child. They have begun to send Aunts-in-training to Canada, to recruit women as replacements for the steady stream of female refugees flowing out of Gilead. (In the sequel, as in the TV adaptation, the sharpest contemporary resonances are with the plight of asylum seekers at the southern U.S. border.)\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/5d703d644618300008e186a6]||||||\n+++\n\nThe four founding Aunts are Vidala, Helena, Elizabeth, and Lydia—the last of whom is the central character in “The Testaments.” Formerly a judge, she once presided over cases about expanded rights for sex workers; she briefly volunteered at a rape crisis center. (In the TV show, she is a former schoolteacher with a background in family law.) Aunt Helena was a P.R. executive for a high-end lingerie company; Aunt Elizabeth was a Vassar-educated executive assistant to a female senator. Only Aunt Vidala was a true believer, working for Gilead before it overthrew the U.S. government. The rest were rounded up at gunpoint, along with all other women of post-childbearing age and high professional status, and taken to a stadium that had been repurposed as a prison. “Some of us were past menopause, but others were not, so the smell of clotting blood was added to the sweat and tears and shit and puke,” Aunt Lydia recalls. “To breathe was to be nauseated. They were reducing us to animals—to penned-up animals—to our animal nature. They were rubbing our noses in that nature. We were to consider ourselves subhuman.”\n\nConfined in this torture chamber, Aunt Lydia finds it ridiculous that she’d “believed all that claptrap about life, liberty, democracy, and the rights of the individual I’d soaked up at law school.” One day, she’s thrown into an isolation cell, beaten, and Tasered. Tears pour out of her eyes, and yet, she writes, a third eye in her forehead regards the situation, as cold as a stone. “Behind it someone was thinking: _I will get you back for this. I don’t care how long it takes or how much shit I have to eat in the meantime, but I will do it_.” She is taken to a hotel room, where, after three days of recuperation, she finds a brown dress waiting for her—a dress she’s seen on the women, future Aunts, who have been ceremonially shooting other women in the stadium as a way of proving their loyalty. She puts it on, picks up a gun, and passes the test. When a Commander assembles the founding Aunts in his office and tells them that he wants them to “organize the separate sphere—the sphere for women,” Aunt Lydia tells him that such a female sphere must be “truly separate.” She understands that this is her chance to establish a part of Gilead that will be free from interference or questioning by men.\n\nShe does not do this out of feminist instinct: she’s seeking a structure that will permit her to acquire leverage over as many people as possible. By the time she begins writing the account that constitutes her portion of “The Testaments,” she has amassed enough power to act like a free agent. “Did I hate the structure we were concocting?” she writes. “On some level, yes: it was a betrayal of everything we’d been taught in our former lives, and of all that we’d achieved. Was I proud of what we managed to accomplish, despite the limitations? Also, on some level, yes.”\n\nIt’s not exactly plausible that Aunt Lydia has been waiting all this time to join the resistance. But her story functions as a parable: the tale of a woman who, in trying to save herself, erects the regime that ruins her. “The Testaments” is the story of her excruciatingly belated turn away from Gilead—of the final days of her plan to bring down the empire, which draws in the other two narrators and relies on their willingness to put their lives on the line. No one but Aunt Lydia, who has been weaving a network of strings to be pulled at her pleasure, could undermine Gilead so effectively. Still, her actions are not presented as redemptive. “What good is it to throw yourself in front of a steamroller out of moral principles and then be crushed flat like a sock emptied of its foot?” she’d once told herself. She is a vortex of ambiguity, pragmatism, and self-interest—the true literary protagonist of Atwood’s Gilead. “Making poison is as much fun as making a cake,” Atwood once wrote, in a short story. “People like to make poison. If you don’t understand this you will never understand anything.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nOne of the oddest things about watching the Handmaid become a figure as much a part of the Zeitgeist as Rosie the Riveter—whom one character in “The Testaments” describes as a woman “flexing her biceps to show that women could make bombs”—is seeing Gilead transform, in the journey from novel to television show, from a niche world that commanded mainstream interest into a mainstream phenomenon that seems to target a shrinking niche. On the show, the couple who imprison Offred as their Handmaid, Commander Waterford and his wife, Serena, are played by attractive actors in their forties and thirties, respectively. I’m not sure what is gained—other than, perhaps, additional viewers—by transforming them into sexy rapists. I also don’t quite grasp who benefits from the sight of a pack of Handmaids strutting in slow motion, fresh off the victory of having resisted orders to kill one of their own in a public stoning, their red skirts swaying to the tune of Nina Simone’s “Feeling Good.”\n\nPrecisely who is being addressed is a crucial and carefully considered matter in the novel. Offred writes to a nebulous “you” that sometimes feels like God, sometimes like her husband, sometimes like a figure she’s invented to keep her from believing that she’s already dead. In the academic symposium that serves as a coda to the novel, Atwood plants a reminder of how inevitable it is that we would interpret Offred’s story in a way that serves our own interests. Delivering the keynote speech, Professor James Darcy Pieixoto—after calling Gilead’s escape network, known as the Underground Femaleroad, the “Underground Frailroad”—urges his audience to “be cautious about passing moral judgment upon the Gileadeans. . . . Our job is not to censure but to understand.”\n\n“The Testaments” ends with another speech from Professor Pieixoto, at a symposium held two years after the one in “The Handmaid’s Tale.” He’s introduced, as he was in the first book, by Professor Maryanne Crescent Moon, and her words lightly nod to the mania for Handmaid costumes: Moon tells her fellow-academics about a planned Gilead reënactment, but advises them “not to get carried away.” Pieixoto then begins his talk by noting the changed cultural climate, in which “women are usurping leadership positions to such a terrifying extent,” and hopes that his “little jokes” from the previous symposium will not be held against him. Gilead Studies has become surprisingly popular: “Those of us who have laboured in the dim and obscure corners of academe for so long are not used to the bewildering glare of the limelight,” he says. “The Handmaid’s Tale” has long been canonical, but it was once a novel. It is now an idea that is asked to support and transubstantiate the weight of our time.\n\nThe other narrators of “The Testaments” are girls who have no knowledge of life before the existence of Gilead. They speak in a manner that suggests that they have made it to a safe place, with a sympathetic listener—which feels like an act of generosity, or political encouragement, on Atwood’s part. Agnes, the older of the two, grew up in a Commander’s family, and recounts her childhood with sadness and a trace of longing, explaining the way that being trained into subservience can feel like being honored, and blessed. “We were custodians of an invaluable treasure that existed, unseen, inside us,” she remembers. “We were precious flowers that had to be kept safely inside glass houses, or else we would be ambushed and our petals would be torn off and our treasure would be stolen and we would be ripped apart and trampled by the ravenous men who might lurk around any corner, out there in the wide sharp-edged sin-ridden world.” She remembers her mother, Tabitha, singing a song about angels watching over her bed—which made her think not about wings and feathers but about Gilead’s Angels, the men in black uniforms with guns. Tabitha asks her, Isn’t it wonderful to be so cherished? “What could I say but yes and yes?” Agnes says. “Yes, I was happy. Yes, I was lucky. Anyway it was true.”\n\nAgnes has a secret identity, which viewers of the TV show will grasp right away. Readers who haven’t seen the show will catch on fairly quickly. The same is true for the other narrator. She is called Daisy when she is in Canada and goes by Jade after she is smuggled into Gilead, but her real name is suggested early on in her portion of the narrative, when she rants about Baby Nicole, the child of a Handmaid and a Commander who became a national figure after her mother smuggled her into Canada and disappeared. (Baby Nicole, a sort of hybrid of Elián González and JonBenét Ramsey, features prominently in Seasons 2 and 3 of the show, though her story plays out somewhat differently there.) “I’d basically disliked Baby Nicole since I’d had to do a paper on her,” Jade says. “I’d got a C because I’d said she was being used as a football by both sides, and it would be the greatest happiness of the greatest number just to give her back.”\n\nAunt Lydia has Gilead wired; she knows how to get Baby Nicole back into the country, and she knows how to get her out again. Like Offred in “The Handmaid’s Tale,” she is addressing an unknown audience—at least, until the end of her story, when she begins speaking to the reader in a way that made me shiver: for the first time in Gilead, Atwood was writing through a character who’d drawn an arrow and shot it straight across the divide. “I picture you as a young woman, bright, ambitious,” Aunt Lydia writes, as the end approaches. “You’ll be looking to make a niche for yourself in whatever dim, echoing caverns of academia may still exist by your time. I situate you at your desk, your hair tucked back behind your ears, your nail polish chipped—for nail polish will have returned, it always does. You’re frowning slightly, a habit that will increase as you age.”\n\nShe goes on, “How can I have behaved so badly, so cruelly, so stupidly? you will ask. You yourself would never have done such things! But you yourself will never have had to.” The breakthrough of “The Testaments” lies here, in the way it solves a problem that “The Handmaid’s Tale” created. We were all so busy imagining ourselves as Handmaids that we failed to see that we might be Aunts—that we, too, might feel, at the culmination of a disaster we created through our own pragmatic indifference, that we had no real choice, that we were just aiming for survival, that we were doing what anyone would do. ♦","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1de941e4c73c088d78eb","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Margaret Atwood","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"margaret-atwood"},{"id":"5c2e1c7c36cecf40192141d5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Writers","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"writers"},{"id":"5c2e1c76ee7fe02cbd163324","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Novels","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"novels"},{"id":"5c2fa8a35b0bef2942ea80c2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books"},{"id":"5c2e1dd841e4c73c088d78df","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"“The Handmaid’s Tale”","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"the-handmaids-tale"},{"id":"5c2e1c832710c62d1081541d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Novelists","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"novelists"},{"id":"5c2e1dcb41c92e2c9b85db8a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Dystopias","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"dystopias"}],"sections":[{"id":"592e2a5036e1a35e5cba5262","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books"}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590b497fdd6207318b5dadaa","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Jia Tolentino is a staff writer at *The New Yorker* whose recent work includes an [exploration of youth vaping](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/05/14/the-promise-of-vaping-and-the-rise-of-juul) and essays on the ongoing cultural reckoning about sexual assault.

They ask me about my college experience and wonder what their own might be. One persistent anxiety trumps all: Will this make me less black? From here, the conversation expands into existential territory, as the students describe all the many behaviors and traits which they fear will place their blackness—in the eyes of others—in jeopardy. Things like reading or writing too much, wearing certain clothes, speaking a particular way, having been to private school, living in the countryside. Sometimes I ask them to imagine a group of white students sitting in our stead. What dangers could we conjure up that might put their whiteness in jeopardy? But we can only ever think of one item—extreme poverty—and even then it would likely not be their whiteness they’d consider endangered but only the privileges that may have once attended it. The imagined white students vanish. We sit together in our blackness and wonder: Can blackness really be so fragile that even a pair of narrow jeans may threaten it?\n\nIn Darryl Pinckney’s life and work, blackness is not so easily revoked. In his essays, a selection of which appear in a new volume, “[Busted in New York and Other Essays](https://www.amazon.com/Busted-New-York-Other-Essays/dp/0374117446),” blackness is as much in a black man’s possession at a British pro-fox-hunting demonstration as it is at the Million Man March—or while reporting on the protests in Ferguson. He will retain it while writing operas in Berlin, or falling in love (with a white male poet), or reading Nancy Mitford. His blackness remains his even as he ponders the historical fact (alongside James Baldwin and Ta-Nehisi Coates) that race is, in the final analysis, a social and political construction:\n\n>In his writings, Baldwin stressed that the Negro Problem, like whiteness, existed mostly in white minds, and in *Between the World and Me* (2015) Coates wants his son, to whom he addresses himself, to know this, that white people are a modern invention. “Race is the child of racism, not the father.”\n\nAs a piece of rhetoric, this has become increasingly easy to assert, and many say it, but it is Pinckney’s habit always to dig behind rhetoric to the historical record, where things are somewhat more difficult to say but no less true; for example, that blackness, too, must therefore be an equally modern invention, for white and black as categories are coeval, the creation of the first necessitating the other:\n\n>Colonial law quickly made a distinction between indentured servants and slaves and in so doing invented whiteness in America. It may have been possible for a free African or mixed-race person to own slaves, but it was not possible for a European to be taken into slavery. The distinction helped to keep blacks and poor whites from seeking common cause.\n\nPinckney’s emphasis on the interpolation of class and race can make him appear closer to the leftist Afro-Caribbean tradition of race theorists—exemplified by thinkers such as Paul Gilroy and Stuart Hall—who reject mythical or essentialist theories of racism in favor of a concrete economic analysis, in which racial distinctions have been created and maintained primarily for the sake of capitalist exploitation. For Pinckney, blackness is not an essential quality found in the blood, the spirit, or even the genes (“I’d never liked that way of assigning innate behavioral characteristics to whole nations or groups. The work of every serious social scientist militated against it.”) but a conceptual framework subject to history, like everything else. “The Irish used to be black socially, meaning at the bottom,” he writes in one example. “The gift of being white helped to subdue class antagonism.”\n\nOf course, to say something is constructed is not to say that it isn’t meaningful. As Coates himself put it, with poetic succinctness, “They made us into a race. We made ourselves into a people.” And it is to the history of this people that Darryl Pinckney attends. The legislation to which we have been subject; the economic and social exclusion we have suffered; the experiences, both personal and public, that we have shared; our joys, our pains. But because he has a truly encyclopedic knowledge of black history—stretching far beyond America to every corner of the globe—the question of who and what this “we” contains remains at the forefront of Pinckney’s inquiry. What exactly *do* “we” share? How do “we” diverge? From the concluding lines of his essay on Coates, “The Afro-Pessimist Temptation”: “Black life is about the group.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This remains a fundamental paradox in the organization of everyday life for a black person.” Reading these lines, I thought of those students in London, never quite sure as to how or where they should draw the Venn diagram between the selves they feel so strongly and the “we” to which they no less profoundly belong. Can a diaspora be a monolith? Should it be?\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nIn “Slouching Toward Washington,” Pinckney’s account of attending the 1995 Million Man March, this question is no thought experiment but a pressing problem: “Everyone seemed in a prescriptive frame of mind, willing to go on record about what black men and therefore black people needed to do.”\n\nAs anyone who has been to a march knows, you find yourself on such occasions shoulder to shoulder with ideological brothers, cousins, and strangers, and, as moved as Pinckney is by the huge crowd, by the solemn courtesy each man shows the other as they move through the throng—“Excuse me, brother&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. excuse me, black man”—not every speech he heard that day spoke to him, and not every voice lifted was the song he wanted to sing. He hears “a troubling capitulation in the exhortations that black men accept responsibility for their families” (he hears the same capitulation thirteen years later, when Obama makes a similar cri de coeur) and wonders why all the men on the Mall that day should have to “swear as black men not to beat their wives, promise as black men not to abuse their children&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as if domestic violence and poverty were not also white problems.” Pinckney is the inconvenient scholar who knows, when Louis Farrakhan stands up and purports to quote a letter of 1612, written by one Willie Lynch, slave master, that this letter is a fraud, written in language that in no way belongs to the early seventeenth century—and yet there is nothing vituperative in his style, and he’s never out for anybody’s blood. “No doubt [Farrakhan] assumed that everyone understood the letter was apocryphal, a parable about fear, envy, and distrust, the means by which blacks are kept disunited,” he writes.\n\nStill, the truth matters. “An invented past can never be used,” Baldwin argued, and Pinckney’s historical precision reminds us that there is more than sufficient systemic oppression in the black past and the black present not to require any added fictionalization. “Instead of Farrakhan’s murky ‘conspiracy of whites against blacks,’&nbsp;” he writes, we might consider that, in the first quarter of the nineteenth century, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, North and South Carolina, and Virginia passed anti-literacy laws, some of which included prison time for anyone who taught a slave to read and write (a fact perhaps worth offering to any young person who fears excessive reading is somehow “not black”), while, as Farrakhan speechified, there existed a perfectly nonfictional, racially biased criminal-justice system that destroyed the lives of far more than a million black men.\n\nWhen, in the book’s title essay, Pinckney finds himself briefly incarcerated (for smoking a joint in the East Village), he recognizes at once his own distance, despite appearances, from his fellow-inmates (all of whom are black or Hispanic), a difference marked not by color but by class. (“The irony, for me, was that an all-black gathering usually meant a special event, a stirring occasion.”) Raised in Indianapolis, in the black bourgeoisie of the early sixties—the world of N.A.A.C.P. meetings and black-owned newspapers, of prestigious black colleges and “Negro History Week”—he is attentive to the hierarchies of black struggle, even as the struggle itself renders his own experience invisible:\n\n>Back then, as now, what constituted authentic blackness was determined by the plight of the majority, which meant the poorest&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. being of the black middle class could make you defensive. You were accused of trying to act white, of not knowing who you were. You were warned that one day soon it would be proven to you that you were black.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In the late 1960s, the black bourgeoisie was synonymous with Uncle Tom&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. depicted as light-skinned, clubbish, collaborationist, materialistic; and yes, there was too much of that.\n\nFor Pinckney, this image has also “obscured the historical truth” of his milieu. “The old black middle class knew more than it wanted to about the front line,” he writes. “There was no refuge in success. A cousin of my mother’s, a student at Atlanta University, was lynched in 1931.”\n\nIt is this awareness of threat, the deadly patrimony of the African-American, that he takes with him as a journalist to Ferguson, listening to the testimony of the people he finds there, bearing witness. Embedded with members of Black Lives Matter and the Reverend Osagyefo Sekou, an activist pastor from St. Louis, Pinckney finds himself far from his usual habitat—the Schomburg library—hiding in the dark of a parking lot, listening to the sound of gunfire as “buildings burned on either side of us.” In Ferguson, too, he experiences a new generation’s disappointment with the same President the old men in Pinckney’s barbershop had heralded with the joy of a prize long deferred. “Black youth are fed up with being branded criminals at birth,” he writes. “Ferguson was the country stepping back in time, or exposing the fact that change hasn’t happened where most needed, that most of us don’t live in the age of Obama.” Pinckney does not share Sekou’s contempt for that President (“I wanted to say that Clarence Thomas is the race traitor, not Obama”), but he understands that whatever future Obama symbolized was—to paraphrase William Gibson—at the very least unevenly distributed.\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nSuch a schizophrenic reality, in which black power, in the form of a President, and black powerlessness, in the form of state violence and oppression, can coexist would surely bring out the Afro-pessimist in any reasonable man. (“Given the little black people have gotten for it,” the Reverend Sekou tells Pinckney, in Ferguson, “voting fits the popular definition of insanity: doing the same thing over and over and each time expecting a different result.”) Yet to entirely elide the difference between the present and the past is to obscure the history of black activism found in families like Pinckney’s, in families like Coates’s, in the N.A.A.C.P. and the Black Panthers and Black Lives Matter, and in all the other organizations and individuals that have done so much to insure that the lives we are able to live today, however imperfect, are precisely *not* the same as they ever were. “Which is better,” Pinckney asks himself, to “believe that blacks will achieve full equality in American society or to realize that white racism is so deep that meaningful integration can never happen, so make other plans?” It is a question he does not answer as much as historicize:\n\n>In *The Souls of Black Folk* (1903), Du Bois argued that the influence of three main attitudes could be traced throughout the history of black Americans in response to their condition: “a feeling of revolt and revenge; an attempt to adjust all thought and action to the will of the greater group; or, finally, a determined effort at self-realization and self-development despite environing opinion.\n\nAnd this insistence on historicization allows him to take the long view on many present pains that may otherwise seem confounding to young people experiencing them for the first time. Instead of adjudicating a painful public spat between Coates and Cornel West, for example, Pinckney places it within a tradition, a long and glorious history of contention within black letters, in which “everyone accus[es] everyone else of running a con”:\n\n>In later years, [Ralph] Ellison remembered [Richard] Wright as a father figure whom he had quickly outgrown. But Wright’s example inspired the young James Baldwin to move to Paris in 1948. Wright was hurt when Baldwin declared his independence from the protest tradition by denouncing *Native Son.* Baldwin later defended his criticism, arguing in part that Wright’s concentration on defining his main character by the force of his circumstances sacrificed that character’s humanity. Baldwin’s turn would come. \n\nIndeed, as Pinckney points out, LeRoi Jones, in his essay collection “Home,” from 1966, “sneered at Baldwin” for being popular on the “white liberal cocktail circuit.” That LeRoi Jones, even after he became Amiri Baraka, remained popular on the white-liberal cocktail circuit, that Baldwin also sometimes sacrificed a character’s humanity for a force of circumstance—into these weeds Pinckney does not go, recognizing instead that this Oedipal battle between fathers and forefathers is practically a black intellectual’s rite of passage. He is not interested in separating good black from bad, nor in discovering who is the “realest.” His focus is black history itself, its twists, its turns, its triumphs and self-negations.\n\n+++inline-recirc\n+++\n\nFor Pinckney, separatism in particular is an old song come round again, although this time appearing mainly as “a rhetorical strategy of the tradition,” divorced from the kind of black-focussed organization and political interventions represented by the Panthers or, much earlier, in the founding of the historically black colleges and incorporated black towns. In the new language of Twitter militancy, “we just can’t” with white people anymore&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and yet here we are and here they are, so what is to be done? As he points out, a despair cannot be total if someone has taken the time to write it out, for even to “address an audience beyond black people is to be still attempting to communicate and enlighten.” One recurring pattern in militancy is that one man’s militant is another’s Uncle Tom:\n\n>The reinvigoration of the marketplace of discussion about that invention, race, has always depended on the passing of the torch, on another generation coming along as a corrective to the one before it, the assumption being that the next generation will be more real and finally tell it like it is.\n\nIf Pinckney is suspicious of this black authenticity contest, it may be because he exists at the intersection of several identities—black, gay, bougie—and so is familiar with how quickly a “we” can become a “you” and an “us.” One of the most striking moments in this book occurs when, while reporting on Hurricane Katrina, Pinckney finds himself in a black New Orleans that seems to welcome him with open arms, which he confesses comes as a surprise to a man who, out of habit and long experience, is used to “bracing myself for the anti-Tom vibe or the anti-queer vibe.” He is, that day, not “you” but “we,” fully included in a black space at a time of black tragedy. Katrina seemed to confirm that what Coates has called “King’s gauzy all-inclusive dream” of multiracial solidarity had been, as Pinckney puts it, “replaced by the reality of an America of competing groups, with blacks tired of being the weakest of the lot.”\n\nStill, within this “weakest” group, Pinckney wants us to remember that there is difference and divergence—and plenty of it. Writing about the saga of Henry Louis Gates, Jr., the Harvard professor who, in 2009, was arrested on his porch by a Cambridge officer, Pinckney casts an unusually caustic eye over “[The Presumption of Guilt](https://www.amazon.com/Presumption-Guilt-Arrest-Henry-America/dp/0230120652): The Arrest of Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and Race, Class and Crime in America,” a book by the Harvard Law professor Charles Ogletree, in which Ogletree interviews upper-middle-class black men, many of them Harvard-educated, as they offer similar encounters of mistaken identity. Given that everyone approached for the book is of the privileged class, Pinckney wonders, is the unspoken assumption that the real offense is wounded class pride?\n\n>One quickly understands the irritation of the black working poor with the outrage of black professionals at the social indignities they encounter. There are worse things than not having one’s high social status acknowledged by whites. Maybe the point is that no black person should have to stomach any bigotry, but the resentment Ogletree’s men&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. express at having been taken for a servant or menial by whites could make one wonder if their parents ever told them that they themselves ought not to judge a black man by the work he was able to find.\n\nWe are prompted to ask ourselves why Gates’s tale of high-status humiliation was so much more compelling, at that moment, in America, than the undisguised systemic racism that continued, throughout the Obama years, to support a prison system in which working-class black men were grossly overrepresented.\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nIn his insistence on such awkward questions, Pinckney proves himself, as one essay title confesses, “Under the Spell of James Baldwin.” For Baldwin never tired of being awkward. Pinckney’s Baldwin, though, is not quite the Baldwin currently experiencing a surge of popularity: the late Baldwin, the TV-talking-head Baldwin, the celebrity Baldwin selectively quoted in the film “I Am Not Your Negro.” Indeed, what Pinckney’s several essays on Baldwin reveal is that Baldwin can *only* be selectively quoted—he espoused so many different, often contradictory, ideas over the years that whichever Baldwin we want is generally the one we tend to get. Pinckney’s Baldwin not only did not despair of the possibility of racial coexistence but considered it existentially vital. (“We, the black and the white, deeply need each other if we are really to become a nation—if we are really, that is, to achieve our identity, our maturity, as men and women. To create a nation has proved to be a hideously difficult task: there is certainly no need now to create two, one black, and one white.”) Pinckney’s Baldwin not only implied that white people can be fellow-travellers in the struggle but that it was possible for his own favorite teacher, a white woman, to be structurally yet not actually black:\n\n>She gave me books to read and talked to me about the books, and about the world: about Spain, for example, and Ethiopia, and Italy, and the German Third Reich; and took me to see plays and films, plays and films to which no one else could have dreamed of taking a ten year old boy.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is certainly partly because of her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that I never really managed to hate white people—though, God knows, I have often wished to murder more than one or two.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. From Miss Miller, therefore I began to suspect that white people did not act as they did because they were white but for some other reason, and I began to try to locate and understand the reason. She, too, anyway, was treated like a nigger, especially by the cops, and she had no love for landlords.\n\nAnd of course Baldwin is also the black writer who was so good at appropriation (or assimilation? Or fiction?) that his most famous novel is narrated in the first person by a white man. In place of the consistent black saint we have recently been offered, then, Pinckney gives us back the fabulously inconsistent man and writer, shot through with both self-hatred and self-love, filled with rhetorical fireworks and hot air and pure genius. The Baldwin who, like Pinckney himself, escaped the American struggle for a while—or got a new perspective upon it—by leaving for Europe.\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nMany go to Paris; Pinckney went to Germany and England. Like for Baldwin, Wright, and Ellison before him, leaving the U.S. brought both exhilaration and anxiety. “You could still find a sort of prejudice among black people against European expatriatism,” he writes, “as if it were only a rung below passing for white”—again, merely an individual solution to what was a problem for the black masses. But his spell abroad in no way lessened his fascination with the diaspora. Instead, in his European essays, he tracks black lives on unexpected journeys and down strange back alleys. \n\nIt is a delight to follow him. How would I ever have heard of a book like “[A Black Woman’s Odyssey Through Russia and Jamaica](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Womans-Odyssey-Topics-History/dp/1558760199): The Narrative of Nancy Prince” if not for Pinckney’s digging it up? I never knew the Communist Party worked to support the Scottsboro Boys, nor that “the cause of freedom for black people mattered to the leading writers of the Romantic movement: Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey, Byron, Shelley,” nor even that “Greenwich Village was a black neighbourhood when Dickens visited in 1832.” In his beloved Berlin, while walking through the German Historical Museum, Pinckney finds that “the chapter on German colonialism occupied a single glass case under some stairs,” where the fact that the German Army massacred thousands of the Herero and Nama people in the early twentieth century is acknowledged only in a brief piece of text on the wall. In London, he wonders at British racial myopia (“Britain seemed to tell itself that black people only got to its shores in 1948 with the HMT Empire Windrush.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was as though British people had never asked themselves what happened to the Africans who lived in London or Bristol in the 18th Century”) but also discovers, in the busy migrant streets, a useful corrective to lazy American ideas of Pan-Africanism: “Nigerians were not Ghanaians, Kenyans were not South Africans, just as someone from Jamaica was not someone from Trinidad.” (This simple but important point reminds me of a conversation I had about “Black Panther” with a Ghanaian friend while we sat at a table full of Americans. Asked what she thought of it, my friend smiled and said, “Imagine a film featuring a fictional European country in which some people dress like Kenyans, some like Ghanaians, some like Nigerians, some like Ethiopians, and so on, and then everybody has the same ‘European’ accent, somewhere between Spanish, French, German, and Polish.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”)\n\nFor Pinckney, returning to the States means reëntering the world of his parents, and taking up once more his duties as they saw them, though with a new awareness of his own complicated role:\n\n>Achievement was self-sacrifice. You must not forget where you came from. You stood on the shoulders of the past. You were one of many. This was serious. You were one of the fortunate and therefore you had a historic destiny to help other black people. My black life was straight; in my white life I could be queer.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The connection in my mind between expatriatism and sexual freedom was very strong. It had a lot of fantasy and self-justification in it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. To talk about things black at home&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. was a way of not talking about myself while seeming to. I used my being black as a way to hide from my black family.\n\nFew are willing to acknowledge that sometimes the things we declaim most strongly usefully disguise the things we find hardest to admit, even to ourselves. “What’s new in racism” happens also to be the first subject of conversation each time I am reunited with my own family, and reading the quote above made me wonder: How much intimate and personal information is sidelined and obscured as we discuss what the President said about Africa, or how the Italians are treating their migrants? “The very serious function of racism&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is distraction,” Toni Morrison once said. Can it even distract us from the “I” that we are?\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nLeaving home has its advantages, but also its costs. Considering the case of the Jamaican writer and poet Claude McKay, Pinckney writes, “His example haunts me. He paid for having been away so long. One day he woke up and discovered that he was out of it and unwanted.” Pinckney, too, was away a long time, while West and Gates, Jr., established each their own fiefdoms, and while Morrison accepted her Nobel, and now he finds himself back in Harlem, right in the middle of what feels to many—to me!—like a second Renaissance. For Pinckney, it must feel something like the fifth or sixth: “The culture of the black diaspora has arrived. Again.” And with it comes a dizzying array of arguments, poses, stances, and claims, some of them surely bewildering to a man who has already lived through so many twists and turns in black history. “I can’t keep up,” he tells us, “and often I can’t sign on.” No matter. “Hotep” may not be in his vocabulary, but, with his portrait of Farrakhan, he offers an indelible example of one. Besides, we have enough people keeping up with the latest debates and signing on with the hottest hashtags. Those interested in the culture of the black diaspora come to Pinckney’s work for other reasons. To know our multifaceted history. To figure out what progress we’ve made and how far there is to go, though Lord knows consensus on this matter is unlikely. Recently, I noticed that even the lyrics of “Lift Ev’ry Voice and Sing”—the so-called black national anthem—are open to interpretation:\n\n>We have come, treading our path thru the blood of the slaughtered,  \n>Out from the gloomy past, till now we stand at last  \n>Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast.  \n>God of our weary years, God of our silent tears,  \n>Thou who hast brought us thus far on the way;  \n>Thou who hast by thy might led us into the light,  \n>Keep us forever in the path, we pray.\n\nHow far is “thus far”? Have we ever been in the light? And, come to think of it, are the “light” and the “white gleam” in those lyrics actual liberations or symbols of a colonized consciousness? Over such disputed territory does black intellectual life rove. No one knows how far we are down the path—we haven’t even agreed on the destination. (Kathleen Collins: “I believe in liberation, but I don’t believe it is at all the thing we think it is.”) But that’s O.K. We’re lifting every voice and singing, often quite different tunes. And how lucky we are to have Darryl Pinckney, who, without rancor, without insult, has, all these years, been taking down our various songs, examining them with love and care, and bringing them back from the past, like a Sankofa bird, for our present examination. These days, Sankofas like Pinckney are rare.

Back in the New Wave bohemian days of the late nineteen-seventies and early eighties, the Lower East Side was the capital of mischief. The low life was still literary. I could be persuaded to go anywhere in search of an authentic urban experience. But then my friends grew up, and I moved far away, as Europe seemed to me at the time. Because I don’t drink and run wild anymore, because I now live down a dirt track in the English countryside, a Manhattan roomful of the young and the smooth can be intimidating.\n\nBut the reggae club the summer before last was known as a chill lounge. Rona let her hair hang over the beat. We were waiting for Billie. I was telling myself not to have a hard time waiting. I was looking forward to my session with that inner-child finder, marijuana. The reggae swelled around me. My head bobbed like a duck’s when there’s bread on the water. I saw what looked like a ballet dancer’s leg. Billie, and a Billie who knew the score. Her opening drink would not take long. We were going to step outside. We couldn’t smoke pot in this reggae club. Not even in a reggae club? That’s how long it had been since I’d been out late on the Lower East Side. \n\nStreet lamps threw a spotlight over pedestrians crossing Second Avenue. Killer taxis left unpleasant gusts. I leaned into the summer heat. Soon we three were alone in the dark of Sixth Street. Rona checked behind her. Then, like backup singers on the downbeat, Billie and I snapped glances over our right shoulders. Maybe some people wouldn’t have bothered, but we were pros. We were veterans of the streets. Rona fired one up, and passed it. We were chatting. I hogged it. We were drifting toward midnight. Billie handed it back to Rona. Three shapes in front of a doorway decided to heckle us. “You’re having a good time.” They sounded like unappetizing old kids. We moved to the curb. “We know what you’re doing.” Rona pushed her hand against the air to let them know that the joke, whatever it was, had to stop. “Smoke it.” We shook our heads at their being so boisterous when they were maybe getting high themselves, and in a doorway, of all places. We should have looked ahead instead of behind.\n\nWe saw the corner and we saw the big man in white-guy plaid shorts cutting a pigeon-toed diagonal from across the street. Everything about him was aimed toward us. His bright white sneakers continued to rise and fall in our direction. A huge meatpacking arm was held out to us, and a big voice was coming at us, too. His other arm came out of his undershirt with a square of ID. We had to keep moving toward him, like something swirling down a drain. There now seemed to be enough light for a film crew’s night shoot. How could we have missed the blue unmarked van parked on the other side of Sixth Street? \n\n“Been smoking something?” No answer. “Put your hands flat on the trunk of this car.” The women, my friends, were side by side at the back of the car. I was on the sidewalk and had to bend over. Other undercovers quickly appeared. “We’re going to empty your pockets.” A woman had taken up position behind Rona and Billie. I felt a hand go into my pocket. My total financial assets held by a faded money clip hit the trunk of the car. “Did you all just meet tonight?” a new voice demanded. “No.” My own voice was thin and completely lacking in the authority of outrage. The money clip was followed by a pack of menthol cigarettes, a disposable lighter, a case containing reading glasses, a John Coltrane—Johnny Hartman CD—“You listen to some good music,” a head of hair said—and a mobile phone. “Where’s your beeper?” He patted me down. “You got a beeper?” “No,” came the thin reply.\n\nThe detectives murmured. They’d found the smallest stub of weed in a matchbook in Rona’s pocket. The woman detective left. The detective with the hair asked the ladies to step over to the sidewalk. Where Plaid Shorts had, like me, the beginnings of his father’s stomach, this one had pecs and biceps rolling out of a magenta tank top. He looked like a television actor in the role of maverick cop. The rest of him was in the suburban version of casual: crisp bluejeans and clean sneakers. \n\n“So you guys just met tonight?” Tank Top asked. It was my turn. He was going to compare answers. Plaid Shorts said he was going over to the van to check something. “How do you know each other?” Tank Top demanded. “School.” If he identified us as middle class, wouldn’t he have to watch himself? Maybe I was trying to prick some white blue-collar resentment; anything to turn the tables a little. When he asked about my beeper, I thought maybe he hoped he’d interrupted something good, criminally speaking, such as a black dude giving two white chicks a taste of the street herb they were about to buy or get ripped off for. But if he saw that we were O.K., then the paperwork on the citation that they gave out in these cases would speed up. One black guy with gray in his beard and one and a half white girls, not two, because by that time they must have figured out that Billie’s honey skin and the Asian cast to her eyes and her Church of England accent were some weird Caribbean story. Yes, Officer, I wanted to explain, the one with the henna highlights is a famous Jewish scientist, the daughter of the British Commonwealth is a banker, and I’m a black guy who needs two pairs of glasses and won’t be on your computer lists, not even a credit rating. \n\nBillie and Rona had shown no emotion until Plaid Shorts brought the handcuffs. Then they gave out soft, pastel exclamations. Plaid Shorts led them, affronted and vulnerable, across the street to the side door of the van. I thought, Rona’s daughter walks just like her. I felt my watch being removed. Tank Top put my arms behind me and pushed my hands high up my back. I felt the metal around my wrists. I thought of my parents and how they would hurl themselves into this if they found out. I felt and heard the handcuffs lock. I thought of my parents and their lawsuits. Back in the good old days, they’d sued our home-town police department to force it to desegregate, and when that worked they sued the fire department—things they did in their spare time, as good citizens, as blacks of their generation, members of the N.A.A.C.P. rank and file. Injustice had only to ring their doorbell, and they were off to the poorhouse. And here was frivolous me letting a white man put me in handcuffs for something other than protest. I remembered what my father had said to my tears at my sister’s memorial, the year before: Keep it together. \n\nBut I was in shock. “I’m going to be sick.” I was starting to list from side to side. “Have you been drinking?” “No.” I was going deaf. “I’m going to pass out.” Tank Top gripped me just below my right armpit, and we started off, but my feet waited before they followed my legs. The world broke into silent, colorful particles. I got to the door and fell flat into the van. Rona’s face floated. I began to hear her. I concentrated on finding her face in one place, something I could get up for and move toward, even if only on my knees. “Don’t hurt him,” Rona and Billie called. “I’m trying to help him,” Tank Top countered. \n\nKeep it together, I chanted to myself. Not because I was a black man in handcuffs in front of two white guys; not because I was powerless, which made it all the more necessary at least to imitate the examples of dignity in confrontations with police which I’d witnessed; and not because I was a grown man losing it in front of two women who, though in handcuffs, were trying to defend me. But because they were my friends. They were the ones with children at home. I crawled over to my friends in the seatless, windowless rear of the van, dripping sweat on them.\n\nPlaid Shorts yanked the van into the street. Because we couldn’t grab, and there was nothing to grab on to, we rolled into Alice-down-the-rabbit-hole positions, and rolled again when Plaid Shorts hit the gas. “This is such bullshit,” Billie said to the ceiling. “This sucks,” Plaid Shorts said. But he wasn’t talking to us. He looked across to Tank Top. “You got that right.” “A big one,” Plaid Shorts added. “Hate it,” Tank Top said to his window. “Total bullshit.” Rona had dusted off her repertoire of apt facial expressions. This one said, “Are these guys for real?” “Five more years, man, and then I’m out,” Plaid Shorts said. “I can’t wait to just do my band.” He did a near wheelie around a corner. We shouldered back up into sitting positions pretty expertly after two corners. Tank Top took some gum from the dashboard and said he had to keep at this bullshit until he could pay off his wife. He told Plaid Shorts that instead of alimony he was offering his wife a once-in-a-lifetime, can’t-refuse lump sum. “It’s like a buyout.”\n\nThe acid-driven power chords of Pink Floyd took over the van. Rona’s expression said, “These guys are too much.” “They’re wild,” Billie’s eyes said back as she looked for the place behind her where the music was blaring from. Maybe the detectives were trying to tell us something. Not that they were nice guys who regrettably had to do their job but that they were better than the job they’d been reduced to doing, and that they, too, had aspirations. The Rolling Stones came on next, and Plaid Shorts sang along. The music was perhaps meant to say that they weren’t uncool, redneck cops having a blast at the expense of the liberal, the black, and the in-between.\n\nI was too ashamed to be sympathetic. Being addressed as “sir” by Tank Top only after I had shown weakness and fear—that was humiliating. A cop could go off at any time. I’d thought of that and had been afraid, and there was no way to take it back. And for what had I lost my self-respect? For an offense the detectives thought beneath their training. What did you do last night? Oh, I was picked up for a reefer and I fainted like a man. The van went up one street and down another. We couldn’t see much, but most likely we were driving around and around as various undercover operations didn’t work out. On one dark corner we waited so long in the van by ourselves that we almost slept. \n\nThe van door slid open, and in the shaft of light Tank Top was helping a Hispanic woman, maybe in her fifties, climb aboard the bummer bus. “Hey, Officer,” she said when we were under way. “My hands too hot.” The detectives parked and helped Rona and Billie out. Tank Top said, “I’m going to loosen these tight cuffs, like you asked.” Then he turned off the lights, slammed the door, and left me with this woman who made unsavory sounds in the dark. I thought she was trying to ditch her vials of crack and the detectives would then claim that they were mine. I went over on my side, practicing the I-was-asleep defense. They put Rona and Billie back in the van, turned on the lights, drove off, stopped again, and got out by themselves. As soon as the doors closed, the Hispanic woman, who’d freed her hands, whipped out a big bag of heroin, snorted it on her knee, and deftly worked her hands back into the cuffs. Rona was laughing in disbelief. Quietly, the Hispanic woman zoned sidewise. The detectives, when they got back in, firmly looked straight ahead.\n\nThe next time the van door opened, a Hispanic man, maybe also in his fifties, climbed in. A dark Rasta youth was pushed in after him. “Ooh,” the Hispanic guy said, and tried to shift himself. He nodded greetings of solidarity. What he’d been oohing about hit Rona’s hygiene radar first. It made delicate Billie draw in her legs. The gleaming Rasta youth sprawled before us had matted dreadlocks that looked like what comes from the back of a furnace when its filter is changed. Maybe I should have thought harder about this being someone’s son, but the stench was overpowering. Meanwhile, he kept up a stream of Babylon raas claat denunciations of the police. He shouted curses on the white man. I thought, Rasta, my brother in Garvey, you are on your own. The detectives paid him no mind. They’d made their quota for the shift.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nWe’d been smoking a joint right around the corner from the local precinct house, that’s how hip we were. The detectives took us inside and the handcuffs came off. After three hours, it was a relief to see my fingers. Tank Top took me and the Rasta youth upstairs to a grotty corridor, and the strip search began. He made the Rasta youth wait in the shadows at the end. He ordered me to hand him my clothes item by item. I was to turn around, bend over, and drop my shorts. He said quickly that that was enough. I was to take off my socks and turn them inside out. “Get dressed.” He asked if I’d ever been arrested. No. He said he would try to tell me what was going to happen. I thought I understood. He motioned to the Rasta and sent me downstairs. He and the Rasta followed moments later. Tank Top had returned my property, except for the phone and the CD. Such stuff had to go over to the lockup at Central, he explained. If that was the case, then the Rasta youth had a prayer shawl and a Torah for Central to deal with. Tank Top tried to talk when he took my fingerprints. “So what kind of things do you write?” After that, he had paperwork to finish. Now and then, he would dial a telephone number, mutter, hang up, and shrug. A clock kept vigil over a wall of “Most Wanted” leaflets.\n\nWhen Plaid Shorts announced that we were moving, around five o’clock in the morning, the Hispanic man asked how much money I had on me. I’d covered the money clip with my hand when Tank Top passed it to me, but, clearly, I hadn’t been quick enough. The Hispanic man said I couldn’t bring in anything where we were going, because it would get taken off me. He informed Plaid Shorts, who agreed that I’d get robbed. Rona put my belongings, even my glasses, in her pocket. My property would be safer in the women’s section, the Hispanic man advised as we were put back into handcuffs and then linked to one another. I was made to lead our daisy chain of handcuffs through the precinct’s main room. As Plaid Shorts increased the pace, two officers by the front door erupted into grunting song. “Working on the chain gang, uh.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nWe hopped out of the van into a street that was still dark. A semicircle of light waited for us to approach. This was the Tombs, that place I’d heard about, read about. Two more daisy chains of prisoners joined ours as Tank Top, having rung twice, banged on the metal grating over the entrance. It rolled up. Plaid Shorts and Tank Top surrendered us in a series of rapid clipboard signatures. When I realized that they intended to abandon us at this concrete threshold, I wanted to ask them when they planned to read us our rights. I’d begun to think of them as our undercovers. They were responsible for us. But they were gone, and we were across the line, and the metal grating was coming down.\n\nI followed a black female corrections officer’s rump up some stairs. A black male corrections officer unhooked everybody. My eyes stayed on Rona and Billie when they were ordered to move to the other side of the corridor. The women went in one direction, the men in another. Green bars streamed along either side of me as I hurried both to keep up with the corrections officer who was now taking us down to the basement and to keep ahead of someone whose footsteps menaced my heels.\n\nThe Rasta youth and I were directed into the last cell of the long jail. I insinuated myself onto the narrow metal bench that went from the bars of the cell to the rear wall, where it made a right angle toward the partition that hid the toilet. Nine mute, tired faces emphasized how cramped and stuffy the tiny cell was. One man was curled up asleep under the bench. \n\nI didn’t want to look too intently at the other men in judicial storage, in case to do so meant something I could not handle the consequences of. I also didn’t want to look away too quickly when my gaze happened to meet someone else’s. However, no one was interested in hassling the new arrivals. Men were waking up, and their banter competed with the locker-room-type noise coming from the corrections officers’ oblong station desk. A short white girl with thick glasses and a rolling lectern called my name. She said the interview was to determine who was eligible for bail, but the questions also separated the wheat from the chaff, socioeconomically speaking. Some guys probably had no job, no taxable weekly income, no address, no mother’s address. She lost patience with the Rasta youth’s decent background. “Education? How far did you get in school?” A community-college degree. Her head was tilted up toward the spectacle of his hair. “We’ll say grade fifteen.” \n\nSome time later, the Rasta youth and I were summoned again. But again we were going only a few yards. A black corrections officer shooed aside someone blocking the door of the new cell, which was large and, sneaked glances told me, held some huge dudes. Fresh apprehension was bringing my body to something like exocrine parity with the Rasta youth’s. I didn’t know what to expect, and so tried to prepare for the worst. We were shoulder to shoulder on a metal bench, like crows shuffling on a telephone wire. The move to this restless population had to be the final, dangerous descent, the reason I’d crammed my watch into my glasses case and handed everything off to Rona. \n\nA black youth with his hair in tight break braids called out to a new arrival, my Hispanic comrade. “Come on in.” The black youth’s knuckles looked as big as Mike Tyson’s. “They took the murderers out early.” He slapped five with a couple of his hulking neighbors and concerned himself with what he could see of his reflection in the metal bench between his thighs. He said something more. I didn’t hear what it was, but it must have been wicked.\n\nA black corrections officer reversed himself and glared through the green bars. “What?” “Nothing, Mo,” the black youth said loudly, evenly. Only one of his neighbors giggled. “Say what, chump?” He was going for the keys at his hip. “You say something?” He was so agitated that he couldn’t get the key in. He was as tall as a basketball power forward. Everything he said was a variation of “You want to say something?” The cell door flew open, and in a few steps the corrections officer was over the massive head of twinkling break braids. “A real man would say something now.” He waited for an answer. I could see him shaking. The black youth wasn’t going to feed him any lines or provocation. The corrections officer pivoted toward the door. He had a baton on his belt, but no gun. He made a satisfied noise with his keys. \n\nIt was not an impressive performance. I knew that. The corrections officer hadn’t come up with any good lines. He just kept repeating himself. I could tell that all twenty-four of my cellmates were thinking how off the hook the corrections officer had been to raise up—the lingo was coming to me—on somebody like that. I was getting excited, feeling that I was on the verge of bonding with the other guys in our high and hip judgment against the corrections officer. He didn’t meet our rigorous standards when it came to “reading” someone in the street manner. The black youth with the oiled, sparkling braids delivered our verdict: “Definitely bugging behind something.”\n\nThe black corrections officer flung the metal door so hard it bounced against the cell bars and rode back some. Giant steps put him in a place that blocked my view of the black youth. Spit was dancing from his head, pinwheel fashion, as he roared, “If I started to kick your black ass now, where would your black ass be next week?” I couldn’t remember when I’d seen such sudden rage. It stopped all other activity in the basement. The tendons in his neck were ready to explode. I couldn’t begin to think what his nostrils might be doing. Maybe our survival molecules were not the only ones to have been put on alert. Some of his colleagues had come by to monitor the situation. They turned back in a way that indicated they’d respect some code not to interfere. The cell was very still as the corrections officer made his exit. The street judgment was in the silence. Nobody wanted to look at him until he’d turned the lock. He’d made his point. He’d shown how dangerous was his longing to have a reason to lose control.\n\nThe corrections officer’s brown skin looked glazed, as though it had been fired in a kiln. He didn’t seem to know how to finish his scene and stood wheezing by the bars. I almost thought he was going to mellow into the dispersal-of-balm-and-poultice phase of tough love. The mask of the shock-tactics practitioner would drop. He’d apologize, give advice, tell the young brothers how he was once on his way to being where they were. The black corrections officer said, “Remember. I’ll be going home at four o’clock. You’ll still be here. You’re in jail. I’m not.” Maybe I should have taken into account the possibility that he had seen and had a lot of trouble doing his job. Maybe he and the black youth already had a story going and I’d missed what started it. But that didn’t matter. Only what he’d said about four o’clock mattered. It wasn’t even nine o’clock in the morning yet. My Hispanic comrade was looking at me. He took his eyes heavenward and clasped his hands. Then he shot me an inaudible laugh. \n\n-=-=-=\n\nJail was going to get me over my fear of saying the obvious, because there was no way to ignore all morning the fact that everyone in the cell was either black or Hispanic. The irony, for me, was that an all-black gathering usually meant a special event, a stirring occasion. I thought back to some black guys I used to know who enjoyed telling me that black guys like me ought to hang out with black groups like theirs. It flattered me to believe that I flattered them with my yearning for instruction in the art of how to be down with it. But this was not what they had in mind. The mood in the cell was like that of an emergency room in a city hospital: a mixture of squalor, panic, boredom, and resentment at the supposed randomness of bad luck.\n\nSome guys, the Rasta youth among them, had elected to slip down onto the concrete floor. They were opting out of consciousness. Our cell had no television, no radio, no newspapers. There was a water fountain, a disgusting toilet, and two pay phones from which collect calls could be made. I don’t know how those guys knew when the corrections officers had their backs turned, or how they’d held on to the contraband of drugs and matches they’d been thoroughly searched for, or how they knew who in which cell had what, but at one moment, as if by secret signal, paraphernalia went flying through green bars from cell to cell. The next thing I knew, guys were taking turns smoking crack behind the waist-high partition of the raised open toilet of our cell. Right there in the Tombs. I guess they figured there was no chance of the crack outsmelling the toilet. I’d switched seats and, as a result, was too near the burning funk. I saw my Hispanic comrade casually walk away from the hot spot, and soon I, too, got up and crossed the cell. His look of approval after I’d eased in somewhere else told me that I’d made the right move.\n\nA black guy with broken teeth, dressed in a torn car coat, emerged from behind the toilet. He ambled around and then seized the floor. “You remember Lucky Lou Diamond? I had twenty thousand dollar over to Jersey City.” I tuned in, eager for a jailhouse Richard Pryor who could turn the cell into something else. “Nineteen-seventy-five? Bunny hat on my head? Your Honor. There’s no mouth on the girl he touched.” His free association promised much, but it gutter-balled into such incoherence that the black youth with break braids spoke for everyone when he barked, “Sit down.”\n\nIt was quiet for a while, but then the Rasta youth snapped to attention. Something jerked him to his feet and set him standing squarely in front of the cell door, his right knee pounding out a steady rhythm. I thought, Just when things were manageable, my brother in Selassie has to flip out. I braced myself for his rap. But he was ready for his lunch. He was first in the line we were commanded to make; first to march out of the cell toward stacks of chalk-colored squares on long, low trolleys that looked like what bricks are transported on at a building site. We were to pick up a sandwich, turn, take a plastic cup of grape juice from another low trolley, and then march back to the cell. \n\nA black guy in an orange jumpsuit—a trusty—called after me to let me know that I’d missed my allotted sandwich. Something about being urged to march rendered me unable to lift anything other than a cup of juice. Very soon the cell was strewn with sandwich remnants. Leaking sachets of mustard and mayonnaise found their way under the bench. A wedge of cheese crowned one of the pay phones. Lunch added to the odors of incarceration. However, there was plenty of room, because some of the men whose size so alarmed me when I first entered the cell had dived to the floor. I counted nine guys asleep in the grime, six of them in the fetal position, their wrists between their knees. Heads had to loll down some broad shoulders before they could touch concrete. A young, crack-thin guy woke and, using his palms for locomotion, crawled along on his stomach to the trash can, where he reached up to extract sandwich remains. \n\nI overheard some of the guys say a little while later that the police had arrested so many people in the sweep of the previous evening that two special night courts had been set up to process the haul. They would start to call names at four o’clock. Waiting might have been easier had there been no clock. At the appointed hour, the only official movement came from the black corrections officer who’d flipped out that morning. I’m sorry to report that he went through all the transparent maneuvers of rubbing it in. He paraded by us on his way back to the oblong station desk, ostensibly laughing at himself for forgetting something. And, just in case the black youth with break braids was pretending to take no notice of him, the corrections officer brought over a white officer holding a clipboard and pointed at the youth. His colleague tapped him a Have-a-good-night. “I told you when you got here not to give me problems.” The black youth looked toward the bars at last, his arms hugging his chest. The black corrections officer flicked a salute.\n\n“Yo, Pops,” I heard the black youth say once the air had calmed down again around us. “Pops,” he called again in my direction. I couldn’t believe that he was talking to me. Pops? Everybody in the cell who spoke to someone he didn’t know said, “Yo, G.” I pointed to myself. Who, me? “Mind my asking what you’re in for?” I made a smoking gesture with two fingers of my right hand. “Uh-huh. You dress Italian. But.” A neighbor of his wanted to give him five for that observation, but he just looked at him hard. It was true. The soundtrack of brotherhood in my head was nearly all Marvin Gaye. It had finally happened: I was older than a cartoon father on television. I was older than Homer Simpson.\n\nI wasn’t sure if Old Four Eyes in the Robert Hayden poem fled to “danger in the safety zones” or to “safety in the danger zones.” It was important to me, sitting there in my concrete elsewhere, which seemed dirtier and dimmer the longer I had to wait.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAs the cell emptied, it got eerier. The few new guys, dressed in their garrulous night selves, were out of sympathy with the general tone of exhaustion and passivity. One new guy ranted about calling his girlfriend to tell her to hook up a plane to Canada, because after he made bail he was going to step off, boy. Another, the lone white, clung to a pay phone. He suggested to a friend that they deceive his brother-in-law. “Don’t tell him it’s for me.” He could press telephone numbers with amazing speed. He insisted to the next friend that she had to get the bail money out of her mother, because he could not, he said, shooting his eyes across us, the nonwhite, do Rikers. \n\nMy name was called, the cell door gapped open, and I floated out. Neither my Hispanic comrade nor the Rasta youth followed. I regretted that I would not have the chance to thank the man who had watched my back. Very soon I found myself upstairs in a new cell that had an iron-lattice screen. Beyond it was the outside world. I heard the voices of what I supposed were women corrections officers, and then over the walls I heard Billie and Rona in their interview cells. They heard me, we heard one another. The public defender on the free persons’ side of the barrier was a heavyset white woman. She went from cubicle to cubicle, guiding us toward a plea: Adjournment in Contemplation of Dismissal, or A.C.D. If we didn’t get picked up for the same offense within a twelve-month period, then the charge would be dropped. A.C.D. \n\nI told the P.D. that I’d used the pay phones. I knew that that afternoon a friend of mine had come zooming down with newspapers and a criminal lawyer and had been denied access. She said they were entitled to hold us for at least twenty-four hours before they had to do anything with us. I said that being in custody was the punishment. I said prosecution of so-called quality-of-life crimes was a form of harassment. She explained that under the circumstances they didn’t have to read us our rights. I was about to compare such offenses to civil disobedience, but the last thing this calm and capable P.D. was interested in was anybody’s vanity. She said that high arrest figures justified the large increase in the number of police on the streets. It was that simple. \n\nIn the courtroom, I felt as though we were guest speakers at a high school, the offenders with us behind the court recorder looked so tadpole, so young. We stood when the judge entered. “He’s not that kind of judge,” a black bailiff said. Maybe because I was minutes and a plea away from getting out, tenderness got the better of me. I thought of my older sister and her practice in defense of juvenile offenders valiantly conducted from files in shopping bags in the trunk of her car. Our case was called, and we sat some rows back from the attorneys’ desks, where we were unable to hear the grim P.D., even if we could have concentrated enough.\n\nGod bless the old-hippie souls who still believed in public life and social responsibility, I thought, but the P.D. had no time for effusive thanks. I’d been so hypnotized by green bars that the marble floor outside the courtroom was dazzling. The white clerks behind the counter in a payment-and-records office were accustomed to a stressed-out public and were rude back. Down in the lobby, Rona and Billie ran for the door marked “Women.” I rushed over to a rickety blue booth for my fix of those former slave crops—tobacco, sugar, coffee. \n\n-=-=-=\n\nPerhaps our elation on Rona’s rooftop was unearned, but we felt like released hostages. We made jokes as soon as we had an audience of friends. Even the squalid bits, when told the right way, got laughs. Maybe we were defending ourselves against our deeper reactions to what had happened to us. Rona’s husband said that now that his little boy was old enough to play in the street he had had to tell him what to do should the police ever stop him. Don’t move; do exactly what they say; take no chances; give no lip. We wondered how popular these sweeps would be after some more white people had been caught in the net. \n\nWe’d been abruptly deprived of our liberty, and that would always make for a chilling memory. And as I’d learned sitting in the cell with all those guys whose stories I didn’t know and couldn’t ask for: the system exists, the system—for the nonwhite young, the poor—is real. New arrest records had been created, but we were out, and friends were standing in wreaths of smoke, savoring the night view of fire escapes, water tanks, and lights in distant windows. \n\nSix days after my release, I was back on the Lower East Side. I understood what Rona meant when she said that she fell in love with New York the day she realized that she could get a candy bar on every corner. But jail worked, it won. I thought, I’m not doing that again. The romance was over. For me, the changes in the streets went with everything else. Once upon a time, people moved to New York to become New Yorkers. Then people moved to New York and thought it perfectly O.K. to remain themselves. Goodbye, Frank O’Hara.\n\n“Yo, Papi,” I heard. I was astonished. It was my Hispanic comrade. They’d given him five days on Rikers Island for possession of a crack pipe. He was selling vinyl records on the sidewalk before he got moved off that bit of Second Avenue. Could I help him out? It would be my privilege. He said he remembered what the black youth with break braids had said when they took him out of that cell in the Tombs. “Kidnapped by the Mayor, y’all.”&#160;♦","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2001/02/05/busted-in-new-york","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c79397f5b30646d05e9","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"African-Americans (Blacks)","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"african-americans-blacks"}],"sections":[{"id":"59111e90df652b705f4ab89d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Personal History","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"personal-history"}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a3cada97f12ef9160832","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/darryl-pinckney","email":"","name":"Darryl Pinckney","socialMedia":[],"title":"Darryl Pinckney is the author of, most recently, the novel “[Black Deutschland](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Deutschland-Novel-Darryl-Pinckney/dp/0374113815).”"}]},"dek":"A nighttime walk leads to trouble.","hed":"Busted in New York","inlineEmbeds":[],"issueDate":"February 5, 2001","ledeCaption":"","modifiedAt":"2019-09-16T17:14:20.009Z","photos":{"tout":[{"id":"5d7c0042c66f2b000819e69b","modelName":"photo","collection":"photos","aspectRatios":{"2:1":{"width":2560,"height":1280,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":198,"height":1280,"width":2560}},"duration":null},"2:2":{"width":1510,"height":1510,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":496,"y":34,"height":1510,"width":1510}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"width":2469,"height":1388,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":43,"y":62,"height":1388,"width":2469}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"width":1989,"height":1492,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":288,"y":39,"height":1492,"width":1989}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"width":1498,"height":1498,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":524,"y":34,"height":1498,"width":1498}},"duration":null},"master":{"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/tny-services/production/2019/09/13/5d7c0042c66f2b000819e69a_010205_r9599.jpg","width":2560,"height":1567,"duration":null}},"caption":"He said he would try to tell me what was going to happen.

In this portrait, the Obamas are invisible, represented only by the house they’d just left, while the actress Cicely Tyson and her lover [Miles Davis](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/miles-davis) have been transported from a long-ago black-and-white society photograph onto the green impasto glory of the White House front lawn. Transported? Transmogrified. The original paparazzi snap is from the 1968 première of “The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter,” a film in which Tyson had a supporting role—in 1968, a black actress could rarely expect more—and she is playing a supporting role here, too. The nature of this support is interesting. Her hand is on Davis’s sleeve, a gesture somewhere between solidarity and protection. Her gaze is steely: as proud and firm as it is guarded. (Meanwhile, his shades are on and his arms are crossed, as if the camera were some sort of weapon.) The support she offers is not meek or retiring (“Behind every great man . . .”), nor is it hidden or oblique (“The power behind the throne”). Instead, it speaks of a double consciousness. On the one hand, her lover is that unimpeachable thing: an American [genius](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/genius). Why should Miles Davis need anyone’s help or protection? On the other hand, he is a black man in America. The same black man who, nine years earlier, found himself beaten up by a New York cop for the twin crimes of escorting a white girl to a cab and not “moving on.” (He had been standing outside Birdland, where he was playing a concert for the U.S. armed forces.) Davis’s name was up in lights, but Davis himself was laid out on the pavement: blood “running down the khaki suit I had on,” as he later recalled. If you can be assaulted outside your own show, you might come to experience many apparently benign situations as rife with the potential for humiliation or violence. It’s 1968: best be on your guard. But to _be_ on your guard—unsmiling, self-possessed, not in need of anyone’s approval, and dressed like you know your own worth—is also to be cool. Cool as a motherfucker. And surely one obvious way to read this translation of Miles and Cicely to the Obamas’ front lawn is as a form of transhistorical wish fulfillment. What if _these_ cool cats met _those_ cool cats?\n\n+++feature-xsmall\n[#image: /photos/5b51fe6af9de7031a30f54e5]|||\n|||\n+++\n\nYet to speak of this painting as I have—conceptually—is to pass over the difference between thinking with language and thinking in images, and no narrative explanation of the relation between these two pictures is as compelling as the horizontal line that marks the credenza in the photograph and the edge of the White House gardens in the painting, or the verticality of the white man in the photo’s top-right corner—with his squared-off shoulders—and his painterly analogue: a blue flagpole, with its crossbar and absence of flag. Taylor thinks primarily in colors, shapes, and lines—he has a spatial, tonal genius. Form responds to form: the negative space around Cicely and Miles in the photograph suggests the exact proportions of the White House, yet in the transition the abstract sometimes becomes figured, and vice versa, as if the border between these things didn’t matter. A burst of reflected light in the photo decides the height and placement of the windows in the painting, while two round signs at the movie première—one for Coca-Cola, the other for “Orange”—which can have no figurative echo in the painting, turn up anyhow on the White House façade as abstraction: a red sphere and an orange sphere, tracking the walls of what, in reality, now belonged to Trump. Like two suns setting at the same time.\n\n+++feature-xsmall\n[#image: /photos/5b51fe6b01fcc54723f63b9d]|||\n|||\n+++\n\n-=-=-=\n\nWhat kind of a painter is Henry Taylor? He is described by others with labels he mostly rejects—outsider, portraitist, protest painter, folk artist. “I think I just hunt and gather,” he has said. “I feel sort of voracious.” It’s his practice to seek people out—in the street, at an art fair, at his mama’s house—and figure them in paint, but each person is configured differently, sometimes hewing closely to verisimilitude, sometimes ignoring it; sometimes attending to the proportion of limbs, other times leaving them out entirely. This variousness of approach finds its mirror in his life, which has also been a story of many different elements combined. Born in 1958, the youngest of eight children (he often refers to himself as Henry the Eighth), Taylor was raised in Oxnard, California, where the pictures in the fancy houses his mother got paid to clean provided some of his earliest exposure to art. Paint itself he might be said to have come to know through his father, a commercial painter employed, for a time, by the U.S. government at a naval air station in Ventura. (He also painted local houses and bars.)\n\nTaylor spent many years in community-college courses—in subjects as disparate as journalism, anthropology, and set design—before taking a job as a psychiatric technician at Camarillo State Mental Hospital. At Camarillo, where he worked for a decade, he began, in his free hours, painting portraits of patients and studying for a B.F.A., at the California Institute of the Arts. He has been painting ever since, at a prolific rate, and on many surfaces besides canvas, including cereal boxes, suitcases, packs of cigarettes, bottles, furniture, and crates. The materials and the style may vary, but the inspiration stays constant: people. (“First of all, I love other people,” he told Hamza Walker, the executive director of LAXART, in a recent conversation in _Cultured_ magazine. “I love to meet them, and the fact I can just paint them.”) His subjects are drawn from wildly divergent walks of life—the famous and the down-and-out, the sane and the mad, the rich and the poor—and the work they inspire has been similarly unpredictable: poignant faces and blank masks; social realism and fantasy; the handmade, the readymade, and the mixed-media sculpture; the multimedia “happening” (featuring real-life Rastas smoking real-life weed); as well as eclectic borrowings from [Alice Neel](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-inclusive-humanity-of-alice-neels-paintings), Basquiat, Degas, Rauschenberg, [Matisse](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/10/20/shapes-things), Goya, Whistler, Alex Katz, Cubism, Constructivism, Congolese sculpture, and more.\n\n+++feature-small\n[#image: /photos/5b51fe6af5a9023836588fa2]|||\n|||\n+++\n\nIf it has been the tendency of African-American artists to stray heedlessly across academic borders and genre demarcations (rap is popular poetry; jazz produces improvised symphonies; gospel is the sexual sacred), then Taylor is firmly grounded in the African-American aesthetic tradition. His greatest subject is human personality, although, in his portraits, personality is not a matter of literal representation but rather a vibe, a texture, a series of vertical block colors laid out on a horizontal plane. This re-states the obvious fact that seeing is never objective, but the intense level of empathy we meet with in Taylor’s portraits, especially between the artist and his African-American subjects, determines everything we see, from brushstroke to framing to gaze. Take “Elan Supreme” (2016). Elan is that admirable friend: a sista who has her shit together—despite all obstacles placed in her path—who is permanently glued to her iPhone, working at the top of her game, with no time at all for anybody’s nonsense. There are echoes of Cicely here (the word “support” seems to be etched along the horizontal. Or is it “suppress”? Or is it “supp”?), but the energy is different; Taylor’s brushstrokes tend frantically rightward, as if his subject were about to walk out of the frame at any moment to take a conference call. “A young master” (2017), meanwhile, is your wiliest little cousin, the one who plays 4-D chess in his mind and may yet grow up to possess the kind of Machiavellian mastery of the streets that will mean, in turn, that the streets can’t defeat him. “My Brother Randy” (2008)—one of multiple portraits of Taylor’s sibling—looks like one of those naturally buoyant brothers, filled with wild philosophy, whom you can only pray that no oppressive counterforce will ever step on or stop.\n\nWhich is all to say that there is a profound sense of recognition and familiarity in Taylor’s work, not only between painter and subject but between painter and community, there being so little anthropological distance between the two. (Taylor, who used to live in a loft studio in downtown L.A. and now lives in West Adams, regularly invites neighborhood types to hang out in his space, to drink and talk or be painted—often all three.) There is, additionally, an interesting division between Taylor’s paintings of local subjects, frequently homeless or otherwise down on their luck—and usually black—and the art-world denizens, mostly white, he sometimes paints. In the first group, he captures the unstudied openness of those who have no sense of formally presenting themselves. (One painting, from 2014, is called “ ‘You Really Gone Pay me to Sit?’ . . . said the panhandler.” ) In the second, we can observe what it means to present oneself as a subject for a portrait by Henry Taylor. Here arms or legs get crossed, eyes turn a little wary or defensive. There is a difference, perhaps, between self-presentation and being present. “To be known and seen” is swiftly turning into a twenty-first-century cliché, but, as far as it regards black life in America, it remains an urgent necessity. “why look, when you can see?” is a recent Taylor title but might also serve as a ruling principle of his work. He paints children at play with their toy guns, undercut with explanatory titles (“I’m not dangerous” and “Girl with Toy Rifle,” both from 2015) intended, perhaps, for those who can’t see a black child for what she is—i.e., a child. And Taylor knows that it’s all too easy to look but never truly see the “Haitan working (washing my window) not begging” (2015), whom he paints in rough but affecting profile, capturing so much: pride, intensity, stoicism, and simple beauty.\n\n+++feature-xsmall\n[#image: /photos/5b51fe6bf9de7031a30f54e7]|||\n|||\n+++\n\nThis is painting that goes way beyond the brute fact of a body. Other people look; Taylor sees. He puts himself in the way of people. His door is open to all kinds of folks at all kinds of hours. In a different place, this simple fact wouldn’t feel so surprising, but in twenty-first-century L.A.—as throughout America—cross-class and cross-economic encounters are regulated and separated by gates, districts, ghettos, railway tracks, walls, and income brackets. Skid-row strangers rarely cross these lines except to be utilized in some form of transaction, often exploitative (prostitution, drug dealing). Taylor, by contrast, asks nothing of them but their presence, and in a heavily defended culture, rendered potentially lethal by the Second Amendment, this rare openness (“I love other people”) feels pointedly radical. The poor, the marginalized, the addicted, the mentally ill, the desperate and forgotten—everyone is of interest to Taylor, and whatever is risked by this faith in strangers (“So far so good,” Taylor told _Modern Painters_. “One girl stole my CD player.”) is laughably minimal when placed next to the gains, both artistic and personal, from the encounters themselves.\n\nAnd, of course, they’re not always strangers. As Taylor has explained, “Every successful black person has eighteen members of his family living in the projects, and we all know someone who’s in the system.” This unique aspect of African-American life means that getting to the “top” never entirely shields you from the “bottom” (or doesn’t allow you, in good conscience, to forget all the people you’ve left behind). It is a painful fact that functions structurally, in his work, to create interesting time signatures, where the past, the present, and the future meet in traumatic collisions. “Go Next Door and Ask Michelle’s Momma Mrs Robinson if I Can Borrow 20 Dollars Til Next Week?” (2017) is a reference to Michelle Obama’s mother and features a figure in a Colin Kaepernick jersey looking keenly through bars at two buildings: the White House and Marcy Projects, the Brooklyn public-housing complex in which Jay-Z was raised. Elsewhere in the painting, a gaggle of men are about to enter the county sheriff’s department’s white van, followed by an ominous-looking black horse. (Horses, in Taylor’s work, appear sometimes as a symbol of freedom and power and sometimes as an expression of the opposite: power restrained, power trapped and fenced in.) It is a painting that exists in many moments in time—in a moment of success and in one of struggle, in the everyday present/past of black oppression and imprisonment and in the aspirational present/future of black success and freedom. Horizontal strips of tree and fence and pavement mark these divisions, but not cleanly. If Marcy were on the prisoner side of the fence, for example, it might be possible to separate the painting out chronologically, into the dark past and the bright future. But Taylor depicts black history the way many black people _actually experience it:_ as simultaneous change and stasis, revolution and stagnation, one step forward, two steps back. In Taylor’s work, the dream is not to finally and speciously separate these two worlds of struggle and success, as O. J. Simpson notoriously attempted to do, but to insist on their relation. The individual black success story—including Taylor’s own—is not sufficient.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAn awareness of the proximity and the ever-present threat of poverty and abjection connects Taylor’s work to the hip-hop that he loves and references, mining Kendrick Lamar’s lyrics for titles or using Tupac’s face for an installation, and painting several lively portraits of rappers themselves. A 2017 portrait of Jay-Z, neither sat for nor gleaned from a photograph, was instead constructed from memory, and so we can rightly describe it as an imagined portrait of an Old Master: besuited, unruffled, arrived. And, considering the way that Taylor plays with time, it’s pleasant to think of this portrait as existing in a fantasy chronology with “A young master,” as if that determined young boy might be another kid from Marcy Projects with big plans, one of the future black success stories Jay-Z himself anticipates in the song “Murder Excellence”: “That ain’t enough—we gonna need a million more.” But even Jay-Z, in Taylor’s version, has not escaped the strictures of racialized America. The confidence of the portrait is deliberately undercut by its title, “I Am a Man,” which, with its mixture of pride and a still necessary defensiveness, has melancholy roots you can trace all the way back to the abolitionists: “Am I not a man and a brother?” Celebrating black success is one thing, but Taylor never seems to forget the many other possible futures awaiting a boy like this young master, possibilities that are, statistically speaking, far more likely than a superstar rapper’s miraculous trajectory. Take Taylor’s neighborhood friend Emory, painted multiple times over the years but never more movingly than in the canvas titled “Emory: shoulda been a phd but society made him homeless” (2017). Was he once a young master? In this portrait, we find him an old man, in utter isolation, gray-haired, raggedly dressed, barefoot in a motorized wheelchair. But he has been seen by Taylor. Known and seen.\n\n+++feature-small\n[#image: /photos/5b51fe6af0c3b96d15e77932]|||\n|||\n+++\n\n-=-=-=\n\nThere is a Picasso-like restlessness to Taylor, a determined promiscuity of intention and execution. You can well imagine a gallerist pleading with him to slow down. The artist who once, back at Camarillo State Mental Hospital, painted a suffering patient synecdochically, with a screaming mouth for a head, could have easily become a commercial artist, using the part to represent the whole, pitching and selling on either side of the horizontal line that bisects so many of his canvases. He could have been a maker of icons and iconography, like Warhol, who made a Campbell’s soup can a metaphor for capitalism and made repetition itself a metaphor for fame. Instead, Taylor has chosen the road of chaos—that is, the road of paint.\n\nFreewheeling through references in his voracious desire to render his subjects truly visible, he retools Degas’s existential mixture of boredom and desire in “La Coiffure” (circa 1896) so that a bored homey can get his braids freshened (“Gettin it Done,” 2016), and borrows some of Barkley L. Hendricks’s graphic flair and advertorial slickness for his portrait of the ice-cool drummer/rapper—and his fellow Oxnard native—Anderson .Paak (“PAAK,” 2017). In “Two brothers (Afrikans) Relaxing in a Paris Park” (2014), you sense that you will surely find Manet’s luncheon just out of frame, in the next clearing, while elsewhere, in “Before Gerhard Richter there was Cassi” (2017), Richter’s famous “Betty” becomes Cassi, with an Afro. The influence of the masterly Kerry James Marshall—Taylor’s contemporary and fellow L.A. painter—is many times explicitly quoted, with something of the same guilelessness and love with which Taylor opens his doors to his neighbors. In paintings like “Fatty” (2006) and “The Darker the Berry, The Sweeter the Juice” (2015), Taylor’s subjects are so dark that they appear, as they often do in a Marshall canvas, almost as silhouettes. But the most affecting works see the world in a manner that is wholly Taylor’s own.\n\n+++feature-small\n[#image: /photos/5b51fe6bf5a9023836588fa3]|||\n|||\n+++\n\nNo one else could have painted “See Alice jump” (2011) or “The Long Jump by Carl Lewis” (2010), in which African-American sports stars leap through the artist’s beloved horizontal, and thus through time, through neighborhoods, through black history itself, offering a vision of the heroic that lives alongside the prisons and the projects, and that exists despite those things, yet does not, could not, erase or justify them. Taylor sees in the round. And he sees most acutely the things from which we may wish to turn. Things like [Philando Castile](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-power-of-looking-from-emmett-till-to-philando-castile) bleeding out in the driver’s seat of a car (“*THE TIMES THAY AINT A CHANGING, FAST ENOUGH!*{: .small}”). The first time I came across that painting, at the 2017 Whitney Biennial, I thought for a moment that it was a presentation of a single eyeball—which, like all Taylor’s eyeballs, reminded me of the eyeballs found in Congolese _nkondi_ statues—existing independently of a face, set instead within a frame of collagelike colors and shapes. Then I saw the face, then the car, then the blue twist of the seat belt, and only after I’d read the title did the little black rectangle atop the pink ball of paint resolve itself into a gun in a white cop’s hand. But I don’t think my first instinct was entirely wrong. As viewers, we are being asked to do more than merely look at an infamous shooting. The challenge is to see how it feels to be shot—the world-destroying pain that arrives with the bullets, as reality streams away from you—and the way that people and things begin to dissolve, becoming colors and shapes, then outlines, then nothing. For Taylor, this outrage from the newspapers becomes a pietà, driven by an intimacy based not on actual acquaintance but rather on personal identification. And this identification must be intense: his own grandfather, Ardmore Taylor, a horse trainer from East Texas, was ambushed, shot, and killed, back in 1933, when Taylor’s father was only nine years old. But many African-Americans will recognize the catechism: _Could have been my cousin. Could have been my brother.

It was “a mixture of the smells of singed cloth, and steam, and a warm dampness; and a bit of the smell of the material, and it’s also a very domestic smell. And I now need so many words to falteringly relate to you this thing, with which you would be familiar instantly.” Oz, who died in December of last year, and who was one of the most prominent writers of modern Hebrew, was preoccupied throughout his life by the limitations of language: its slipperiness, its inability to fully convey meaning. The written word, he often argued, could only ever be a low-fidelity reproduction of the fullness of being; any text was ultimately humbled by the reality that it sought to represent.\n\nAfter Oz’s death, the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation, known as Kan, released a number of radio interviews with him from its archives. The earliest, conducted from his room in Kibbutz Hulda, in 1964, took place not long before the publication of his first book, “[Where the Jackals Howl](https://www.amazon.com/WHERE-JACKALS-HOWL-Amos-Oz/dp/0547747187)”; the last is from the months before his death. It is uncanny how much the twenty-five-year-old Oz sounds like the seventy-nine-year-old Oz: as articulate and as resolute, almost oracular, in his tone. When you listen to the interviews in sequence, your initial awe at his easy eloquence wears off a bit with the repetition, sometimes word-for-word, of some of his insights. Words, he said in 1975, and again, in 1978, are *esek bish*, a mess—a cluttered affair that fogs up meaning even as it tries to get it across. But the repetitions also point to his fixation, verging on obsession, with the impossibility of capturing in writing what it was that he wanted to communicate.\n\nFor Oz, stories were an attempt to impose order on a world that has none—not so different, he thought, from Paleolithic cave paintings, in which prehistoric artists stilled wild beasts, giving themselves an illusion of control over nature. Still, Oz argued, the most primal human experiences transcend words: “Humans come into the world crying, make love moaning, die sighing,” he said in the 1978 interview. “When you need to communicate these things with words, it’s hard.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Some things get lost. You need to trust the reader, to some extent, to produce from the words that which is beyond words.” In her essay collection “[Upstream](https://www.amazon.com/Upstream-Selected-Essays-Mary-Oliver/dp/1594206708),” the poet Mary Oliver observed that “Writing is neither vibrant life nor docile artifact but a text that would put all its money on the hope of suggestion.” A bet, as Oz put it, that different people will find beauty in the same contours.\n\nOz was as interested in the particularities of Hebrew as he was in the general problem of language. By his late twenties, after publishing his first three books (a collection of short stories and two novels), he was already one of the best-known literary practitioners of a language that had emerged from its cryogenic state just a few decades earlier. Hebrew newspapers and the first Hebrew novel appeared early in the nineteenth century, but the language was stilted and biblical. Within a century, Hebrew had become a supple, living language, first in literature and then in speech—a compelling and mercurial medium, rapidly adapting to the needs of modernity (imagine Latin repurposed to portray iPhones, third-wave feminism and [Billie Eilish](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/billie-eilish-and-the-changing-face-of-pop)). “The Hebrew of my childhood,” Oz told [David Remnick](https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/david-remnick) for a [2004 Profile](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/11/08/the-spirit-level) in this magazine, “was a language making its first steps in the open, like a creature bred and created in a laboratory or in a zoo and set free.”\n\nIn “[Jews and Words](https://www.amazon.com/Jews-Words-Amos-Oz/dp/0300205848),” an essay that Oz wrote with his daughter Fania Oz-Salzberger, the two proposed an understanding of Jewish historical continuity as “primarily textual,” with Jewish lineage transmitted through words rather than blood. In that telling, the reëmergence of Hebrew as a spoken language was not only a rebirth but a rupture. Oz’s life traced the aftermath of this rupture. Born in 1939, in Jerusalem, Oz was the son of two recent Eastern European émigrés to Mandatory Palestine. His father was a librarian who read in sixteen or seventeen languages; his mother read in seven or eight. As part of their commitment to forging a new life—to leaving behind not only forced statelessness but also diasporic cosmopolitanism—Oz grew up only with Hebrew. “Maybe they feared that a knowledge of languages would expose me to the blandishments of Europe,” he wrote in his memoir, “[A Tale of Love and Darkness](https://www.amazon.com/Tale-Love-Darkness-Amos-Oz/dp/015603252X),” “that wonderful, murderous continent.”\n\nTo Oz, writing in Hebrew was like sculpting in solid rock and crusted sand at the same time. With one foot in the Hebrew of the Bible and the other in the mélange of linguistic influences that made up the vernacular in a young country of immigrants, the language could make a speaker prone to making missteps of word choice: “you don’t want to bring in Isaiah and Psalms and Mount Sinai” to describe an argument over pocket change, Oz told the *Paris Review* in 1996\\. Modern Hebrew drew not only from earlier forms of the  language but from Polish, Yiddish, Russian, and various dialects of Arabic. If the slow evolution of most languages allowed words to “resonate with an entire cellar of meanings and associations and lullabies and old wives’ tales,” then, for much of the twentieth century, readers and writers of Hebrew had to create their own harmonies.\n\nThis was also what made writing in Hebrew hugely tempting (like working “on an active volcano,” he said in both the 1978 radio interview and in the *Paris Review*). Oz compared the language to Elizabethan English, “when a writer and poet could still make new laws about language.” (In this, he echoes the literary critic George Steiner, who wrote that “Marlowe, Bacon, Shakespeare use words as if they were new, as if no previous touch had clouded their shimmer or muted their resonance.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The great treasure of it lies before them, suddenly unlocked, and they ransack it with a sense of infinite resource.”) Along with other novelists and poets of his generation, Oz revelled in the sense of possibility that modern Hebrew afforded, in the unique timbre of strings stretched between such temporally distant worlds.\n\nIn his interviews, Oz revealed his delight in Hebrew’s expanding resonances, but he was also alive to the ways in which language can be abused. “Every destruction begins with the destruction of language,” he said, “when you call things by names which are not their own.” Oz, who wrote columns and essays for the Israeli press (he famously used different-colored pens for politics and for prose), framed his role as a public intellectual through his relation to language, and much of his political writing began at that point. In the first column he wrote after the Six-Day War, in which Israel took the Gaza Strip from Egypt and the West Bank from Jordan, he rejected the new practice of referring to the military captures as “liberated territories.” This was, in his view, a “contamination of language”: territory could never be “freed,” and liberation only held meaning in a human context. About the 1982 Lebanon War, which was initially dubbed Operation Peace for Galilee, he said, “War is not peace. Call it war.” \n\nDespite these misgivings about the use and misuse of language, Hebrew remained, to Oz, Zionism’s greatest achievement. Certainly, it was the one he was least ambivalent about. “I have said many times that I’m a chauvinist only in respect of the language,” he told the *Paris Review*. “I feel for the language everything that perhaps I don’t always feel for the country.” Modern Hebrew literature—its beats and its tenor, its themes and its subjects—was a source of pride, as broad in range as it was particular. Oz identified its central topic as the “troubles of the Jews,” but this seemingly narrow focus did not preclude it rising to a more universal, humanistic plane. “The troubles of the Jews, in the broadest strokes, are not so different from the troubles of humanity,” he said in 1978\\. “Jews search for something they cannot find; find something they didn’t want; find something they wanted, but it’s not quite right. Other humans are like this, too… Jews are also like other humans, when they try hard.”\n\nThroughout, Oz tied the boundaries of language to the boundaries of ideology. People with too much faith in a specific program, who prescribe too eagerly to an all-encompassing gospel of change, can inevitably become fanatics when the world does not fit neatly into their formulas, he argued. Just as reality cannot be fully expressed in language, it also resists confinement to a single belief system: “We live in a world full of contradictions.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and ideology cannot stand contradictions.” Rather, Oz advises perplexion—that we all be driven by our confusion to constantly examine and re-arrange our attic of ideas. His final essay collection, “[Dear Zealots](https://www.amazon.com/Dear-Zealots-Letters-Divided-Land/dp/1328987000),” opens with a broad exploration of fanatics and fanaticism (single-mindedness, humorlessness) and concludes by analyzing the pathologies of those perpetuating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nGiven this outspoken aversion to dogma and intellectual rigidity, it is perhaps ironic how consistent his own views remained over the decades. Secular, liberal Zionism, of which Oz was one of the clearest articulators, has its own set of prescriptions for the world’s problems, its own utopian streak, its own easy solutions to the intractable conflict in the Middle East. Oz subscribed to these aspirations, though he was usually clear-eyed about the obstacles to bringing them about.\n\nThere’s an old Zionist hymn that begins with the line “Here in the land our forefathers ached for, all of our hopes will be fulfilled.” The tune is borrowed from an older Yiddish song titled “Goles Marsh,” or “Exile March,” and the Hebrew rendition subverts the original lachrymose lyrics, promising to replace the tears of the diaspora with a life of freedom and farming (and, of course, Hebrew). “Not two or three hopes, *all* of our hopes,” Oz noted cynically about the song’s opening refrain and the early Zionists who sang it. No dream too small. “Even when they were already *here* they would sing ‘*there*,’ ” he added. Always in a state of flux, never quite arriving (other humans are like this, too). Still, when his kids were young, it was one of the songs that Oz would sing to them every night before they went to sleep, half bemused and half believing. It was the last song sung before the crowd dispersed at his funeral, as he was laid to rest in the kibbutz graveyard.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1d412bfcc72cd92d05f1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1d412bfcc72cd92d05f1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Hebrew","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"hebrew"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Hebrew","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"hebrew"},{"id":"5c2e220a01de442c9e3e615d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e220a01de442c9e3e615d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Hebrew

The movement’s leaders—preëminently, David Ben-Gurion—incubated modern Hebrew, fought the state of Israel into being, ingathered the “exiles,” put [Eichmann](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1963/02/16/eichmann-in-jerusalem-i) on trial, and dominated the small, largely socialist country that Israel was before it was overwhelmed by the forces of post-1967 messianism. Labor Zionism dared to return Jews not to synagogues but to history. \n\nToday, less than a fifth of the Israeli population—albeit much of the educated élite, most of it descended from the pioneers from Eastern Europe—has traces of Labor Zionism in its bones. It is a population that is now overlaid by descendants of a larger contingent of North African and Middle Eastern refugees and immigrants, more recent migrants from the former Soviet Union, Arab citizens mainly from the Galilee, ultra-Orthodox Jews from Jerusalem and the United States, and the young cosmopolitans running the Tel Aviv branches of Google and Ernst & Young. Oz’s death will inevitably seem like a metaphor for a moribund Israel, especially with an election coming in April and hard-rightists leading, as usual, in the polls. “Let’s say,” Benny Ziffer, the culture editor of *Haaretz*, wrote of Oz, that “the president of the so-called ‘white tribe’ died Friday.” Nobody left from its ranks, Ziffer added, will write “so enchantingly as to briefly seem to persuade us of the righteousness of his path.”\n\nSome observers suggest that the Labor Zionist gestalt engendered liberal Israel. This is not quite right. Among the Labor Zionists of Oz’s youth, free thought could be tolerated—indeed, given the rabbinic cloisters that their Zionist parents had punched their way out of, it was encouraged—but liberal individualism was another matter. That was “*enochiyut*—” literally, “me-ism,” self-centeredness. You were expected to be a dissident, not an existentialist. You were expected to see the institutions that advanced abstract citizenship, such as a formal Bill of Rights, as taking a back seat to those that advanced Hebrew national renewal, such as the Law of Return. Indeed, the latter were assumed to have been necessitated by the former having failed in twentieth-century Europe, the precinct of anti-Semitic Christendom. Oz, who was born Amos Klausner, chose this world, reinventing himself at the age of fourteen, leaving Jerusalem (and his father’s rightist Revisionist family) two years after his mother committed suicide, to join the Kibbutz Hulda and to rename himself “*Oz*,” or “strength.” He was, [he told David Remnick](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/11/08/the-spirit-level), in 2004, “the Huckleberry Finn of history,” except that his raft was on “a river made of books and words and stories and historical tales and secrets and separations.”\n\nTo imagine yourself navigating such a river required not only a grasp of war’s traumas but ideological fervor, the discipline that came from the Army and the collective, and a feeling of exceptionalism—a sense of being the “new Jew,” something that could tip over into utopian smugness. You would be alert to deviations. In 1961, the twenty-two-year-old Oz, by then a rising intellectual identified with movement leaders in Hulda who were skeptical of Ben-Gurion’s socialist constancy, met with the Prime Minister, along with a number of Oz’s comrades, to discuss writers of the younger generation. Oz joined in [cautioning](https://www.haaretz.com/1.5132377) “the old man” that a new book of poetry by Yehuda Amichai was “dangerous,” because it presented a kind of nihilism. “You should read it,” he said, “not because it is important but because it expresses something.” Oz, who softened considerably over the years, no doubt cringed when *Haaretz* published the transcript of that conversation, in 2010\\. Yet a couple of years ago, at a ceremony in Jerusalem honoring the late literary critic Menachem Brinker, I heard Oz speak of Brinker’s birthplace and his own, in the vicinity of the Kerem Avraham neighborhood of Jerusalem—which is also the birthplace of such comrade-pillars of Israel’s left intelligentsia as the writers A. B. Yehoshua and Haim Be’er and the philosophers Avishai Margalit and Adi Zemach—as if the area were a world-historical incubator.\n\nIt was with something like this sense of communitarian duty that Oz—along with a few others, including the writer Muki Tsur, who was also at the meeting with Ben-Gurion—committed his own first dissident act. By 1967, Oz had published his first stories, and a novel focussed on the committed, idiosyncratic, somewhat jaded characters whom he encountered on the kibbutz. In the days after the 1967 war, though, he rushed around with a tape recorder, chronicling the experiences of the Israeli soldiers who had fought in it, as he himself had. The book that he, Tsur, and other collaborators produced from these recordings, “Siach Lohamim,” or “Soldiers’ Conversation” (eventually published in English as “The Seventh Day”), rendered the awful battles as immediate memories, humanizing them and implicitly undermining the idealizations and the euphoria with which the war was increasingly being celebrated. (With a corresponding sense of tragic responsibility, Oz helped to make a 2015 documentary based on material that the authors had cut from the transcripts, including soldiers’ testimonies of summarily executing prisoners of war.) The book proved a kind of launch pad. The more Oz wrote, the more he seemed a symbol; the more symbolic he became, the bolder he was. He provided, Remnick recalled, one of the first warnings about post-1967 inertia. “Even unavoidable occupation is a corrupting occupation,” Oz wrote in the now-defunct Labor Zionist newspaper *Davar*. \n\nMost Israelis first understood Oz as a political figure to be reckoned with in 1973, when, after having fought in the Golan Heights during the Yom Kippur War, he was interviewed on the nation’s only television station. Ever since the 1956 Sinai campaign, Moshe Dayan, then the defense minister, had held a moral prestige that bordered on a personality cult; after 1967, Dayan’s notion of “security borders”—borders so intimidating that surrounding Arab countries would not dare attack—had been taken for granted as the next best thing to peace. Dayan and government spokesmen were still trying to spin the 1973 war’s eventual victories as a tribute to their strategy. (“Syrians will learn that the road from Damascus to Tel Aviv is also the road from Tel Aviv to Damascus,” Dayan said.) In the interview, Oz filled the screen—cool, fierce, and articulate—and directly challenged Dayan’s bravado, pointing to lost opportunities and decrying the hubris in his strategy, though not without compassion. “He knew that even a fallen hero is still a hero,” the writer Yael Dayan, Moshe Dayan’s daughter, and Oz’s devoted friend, told me. I was not in the Army, but I was working the farm of a friend who was at the time; neighbors had lost sons, husbands, and brothers. Even my friend’s family, which had idolized Dayan, felt the shock of Oz’s truth. With his words, the country changed. In 1978, after the rightist Menachem Begin was elected Prime Minister—partly as a protest against the manifest failures in leadership that Oz had pointed to—Oz was among the founders of the activist organization Peace Now, which formed after a group of reserve officers addressed a letter to Begin protesting his policies. “A government that prefers the existence of settlements beyond the Green Line to the resolution of our historic conflict and creation of normal relationships in our region will make us question the justice of our cause,” the letter stated.\n\nI met with Oz nine years later, in 1987. He was at Boston University for a residency, and I was covering Israel for American magazines, and we met periodically for lunch. We had both lost parents to suicide, but those subjects never came up. Instead, we spoke about Likud’s eclipse of Labor Zionism, or the chances of  Shimon Peres—recently the Prime Minister in a rotation agreement with Likud’s Yitzhak Shamir—regaining power in the age of Ronald Reagan. Oz’s masterly reportorial book “[In the Land of Israel](https://www.amazon.com/Land-Israel-Harvest-Translation/dp/0156481146),” which recorded conversations with people across Israel, from neglected immigrant towns to West Bank settlements, had recently come out. I had published a history of Labor Zionism’s decline, and he assumed, not incorrectly, that I might learn from him. Yet I don’t remember a moment of condescension. I do remember implying that I could hardly get through “[My Michael](https://www.amazon.com/My-Michael-Amos-Oz/dp/0156031604/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1546708569&sr=8-1&keywords=amos+oz+my+michael),” his dark novel about a woman going mad, which seemed more atmospheric than intimate. He told me, in turn, that he found Philip Roth’s Zuckerman novels short of great literature, since the subject was only the author’s own psyche—what he called, speaking with Remnick, “indoors literature.” \n\nIronically, his 2002 memoir, “[A Tale of Love and Darkness](https://www.amazon.com/Tale-Love-Darkness-Amos-Oz/dp/015603252X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1546708610&sr=1-1&keywords=amos+oz+a+tale+of+love+and+darkness),” becomes a masterpiece precisely when he goes “indoors,” recalling with precision, and agony, his state of mind as his mother wilted and eventually took her life. The best indoors memoirs—by Arthur Koestler, say, or Dave Eggers—would continue the story, reflecting on how such childhood pain might warp grownup pleasures and ethical choices. But introspection of this kind is not what one looks for in Oz’s books. His characters, even his remembered loved ones, ride the river of history. “Among the immediate reasons for my mother’s decline,” he told Remnick, “was the weight of history, the personal insult, the traumas, and the fears for the future.”\n\nThe inclination to place the personal within the historical—so much that characters can seem to be personifications—might thwart some writers. Oz turned it into genius. There is a Hebrew word, *tzalul*, which means “clear” in the sense of transparent, pure, sane. It was hard to leave a column or a lecture or a story of Oz’s and not think that his fame grew from clarity of this kind. There were literary asides. “When I know what to think, I write an essay. When I don’t know what to think, I write a novel,” he told me. There were, similarly, aphorisms, such as “Political optimists are always walking around with a scowl, pessimists with a smile, because optimists are always disappointed and pessimists are always relieved.” Most of all, there were what might be called therapeutic interventions. Last summer, he told an audience at Tel Aviv University that it would be impossible for Palestinian refugees from pre-state Israel to get their homes back, or reconstruct their former pastoral lives, even if Israel simply opened its borders; they are, he said, “seeking in physical space what was lost to time.” \n\nIt is not enough to praise a writer’s style when it’s a style of this kind. You can’t write this clearly unless you can think in uncluttered ways and preach with poise—as if you’ve lived the answers. Which brings me back to what can only be called the Labor Zionist faith in the Hebrew republic that Israel was between 1948 and 1967. For all its defects and its ominous claustrophobia, this Israel seemed to Oz to have achieved a model of secular Jewish nationalism, whose socialist institutions will never be reproduced but whose values various literary characters (and their authors) could embody. You got the feeling that Oz wanted to preserve what my wife, Sidra DeKoven Ezrahi, a professor of literature at Hebrew University, calls “the younger, slimmer Israel.” As with all prophets, there was something vaguely reactionary in his message—a call back to some vaguely sacred standard. \n\nIn recent years, Oz coined perhaps his most influential turn of phrase, which has been picked up by virtually all politicians in the peace camp and implies the solidarity of that “slimmer” Israel. Namely, he said that Israelis and Palestinians must “divorce,” that they must split “this small house into two little apartments.” Superficially, the claim is inarguable: most on each side want to exercise political sovereignty in separate entities. And many Palestinians revere Oz’s humanism; the President of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, wrote a letter paying tribute to Oz . But divorce is not a neutral metaphor, and Oz made clear that he meant something quite radical by it: that the two peoples should get more or less entirely out of each other’s lives. (He often quoted Robert Frost on the virtues of “good fences.”) In effect, he was saying that the two-state solution should finally solve what the 1948 war did not. In his view, the occupation was to be condemned because it was inviting, ultimately, a demographic nightmare, an “Arab state from the [Mediterranean] Sea to the Jordan River.” And he believed that, as he put it last summer, no form of liberal bi-nationalism can work “except in six places: Switzerland, Switzerland, Switzerland, Switzerland, Switzerland, and . . . Switzerland.” \n\nFor Oz, those principles were axiomatic, and, if one lived in 1961, they would have seemed expansive, even forward-looking. The problem now is that, however implausible a single state is for both the Israelis and Palestinians, the idea of radical separation [is impossible](https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2018/02/02/confederation-the-one-possible-israel-palestine-solution/). The populated parts of Israel and the Palestinian territories are together the size and area of greater Los Angeles—roughly fourteen million people live in five thousand square miles—and they share a single business ecosystem and urban infrastructure. The Israeli right is sensible to worry that lone-wolf terror attacks on Ben-Gurion Airport, four miles from the West Bank, would bring down the cybernetic Israeli economy for months. At the same time, Israeli and Palestinian entrepreneurs are right to see their future countries not as fortresses but as hubs. The million and a half Palestinian citizens of Israel—many of whom speak Hebrew as well as Arabic—are correct to argue that they should not be lumped in with “Arabs,” that they are a distinct minority seeking equal rights in a state that privileges, in anachronistic ways, legally designated Jews, and that Israel’s democratic left cannot regain power without them. I could go on.\n\nOz’s version of the two-state solution may gesture toward moral reciprocity, then, but as a practical matter it chases the past. It may be that no two-state solution ever comes into being, but if it does it is more likely to be a confederation, like the European Union or Canada, than it is to follow the partition plan of 1947, or even the Geneva Accord of 2003, which Oz helped to negotiate. Even Yossi Beilin, who midwifed the Geneva agreement, advances confederal ideas today, not the partition that Oz envisioned: “cohabitation, not divorce.” \n\n“Oz’s voice will be missed, and the evidence pours in of what a decent and giving man he was,” Yehuda Melzer, Oz’s contemporary and the founder of the Books in the Attic publishing house, told me. “But the public Oz was also trapped by an image he carefully invented for himself at a very young age, when he went to the kibbutz. More than six people in the room, and he felt he must assume the podium. He chose all the right ideas and associations. His writing appealed to the right readers. But the world he desired was gone before he was.” It was something in space that was lost to time.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e31562bc86f2c9a244e4e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Amos Oz","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"amos-oz"},{"id":"5c2e1c7c36cecf40192141d5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Writers","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"writers"},{"id":"5c2e30a7b75f002c8941e8ca","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Israel, Israelis","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"israel-israelis"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Daily Comment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"daily-comment"},{"id":"5907eefc98449f3364193d6d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Page-Turner","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"page-turner"},{"id":"59c2827ea07dab556b6c7342","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Postscript","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"postscript"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a00ce019dfc3494ea4143","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/bernard-avishai","email":"","name":"Bernard Avishai","socialMedia":[],"title":"Bernard Avishai teaches political economy at Dartmouth and is the author of “[The Tragedy of Zionism](https://www.amazon.com/Tragedy-Zionism-Revolutionary-Israeli-Democracy/dp/1581152582),” “[The Hebrew Republic](https://www.amazon.com/Hebrew-Republic-Secular-Democracy-Enterprise/dp/0151014523),” and “[Promiscuous](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300192414/promiscuous),” among other books.

For eighteen years, he has lived in the desert outpost of Arad, a town of twenty-eight thousand, between Be’er Sheva and the Dead Sea. In the late afternoon, after a day at his desk, he often takes a seat at a café in the town shopping mall. He doesn’t have to wait long before someone says hello or sits down to debate, perhaps even going so far as to denounce him for his public endorsement—first sounded in 1967, in the days after the Six-Day War—of a two-state settlement with the Palestinians. Oz is a liberal, and the Russians who increasingly dominate the population of Arad are not. But he is always happy to talk, a “word-child,” hyperarticulate. Fully formed paragraphs issue forth in conversation with a hypnotic, liquid ease. Sooner or later, his would-be debater is charmed and silenced.\n\n\n\n\n\nOz is in his mid-sixties, trim and, generously appraised, of medium height. He seems always to be squinting into a distant sun. When he first became famous, nearly forty years ago, reviewers and readers routinely commented on his rugged, emblematic looks: the light hair and light eyes, the deep tan, the spidery wrinkles near his eyes and the corners of his mouth. Dressed in rumpled chinos and a work shirt, Oz became part of the mid-century Zionist iconography: the novelist-kibbutznik, the Sabra of political conscience. His is still a handsome face but, depending on the angle or the expression, it now exists in a kind of temporal flux. A turn of the head this way and he is back in the vineyards and olive groves, a turn that way and he is a study-bound éminence grise. He wears bifocals on a string. Several years ago, he had his knees replaced. He walks as if on broken glass.\n\n\n\nOz is earnest, romantic, generous, sentimental, and pleasantly vain. He is well aware of his image, and is quick to make light of it. “European Zionist writing maintained that the moment the Jews set foot on Biblical soil they will be totally born again,” he told me one morning in his basement study. “They will be a new race. Even physically they will change. They will become blond, suntanned. Both of my parents were dark. In a genetic-ideological miracle, they succeeded in having a blond son. Which gave them infinite pride and joy. They were raving at my blondness! They thought it was the sun, the air. It’s Jerusalem! They used to call me _shaygets._ You know this Yiddish word and what’s behind it? It’s a little Ukrainian pig herder, who throws stones at Jews. I came from a long line of distinguished scholars and rabbis. Why would they be so happy to call their son a _shaygets_?”\n\n\n\nBorn in Jerusalem, Oz spent more than thirty years living on a kibbutz in central Israel, where he married and raised two daughters and a son. He moved to Arad in 1986. Until then, he had never owned anything more than some books and the clothes in his drawer. From the time he began earning serious royalties, with his 1968 novel “My Michael”—the story, told in a woman’s voice, of a disintegrating marriage, set against the Suez War of 1956—he plowed all his earnings back into the general account of the kibbutz. “It wasn’t until I was forty-six and moved to Arad that I had any private property, or even a checkbook,” he said. “You will not find someone with a more exotic background this side of North Korea.”\n\n\n\nOz is a man of nearly obsessive order: orderly sentences, orderly bookshelves, soldierly rituals. Every morning at around dawn and every evening at sunset, he leaves his modest house and makes his way to the desert. Arad is built on the flint, grit, and negligible scrub of the Negev. In the Book of Numbers, the Canaanite king of Arad battled Moses and his flock before the Israelites took the city. For three thousand years thereafter, the place made little impression. Set on a promontory with a view of Jordan, the Mountains of Edom, and the Dead Sea (a mercury gleam in the distance), modern Arad was founded in 1962 by the Israeli government, in the hope of shifting some of the growing population away from the cities of the coastal plain. The transformation came in an instant: the irrigation systems and the power grid, the housing—bungalows, concrete apartment blocks—the trees and the radar towers, the shopping mall. Arad was soon a frontier town as functional and as dull as the distant suburbs of Los Angeles.\n\n\n\nOne evening this summer, I went with Oz and his wife, Nily, on one of their desert rambles—first by car, then on foot. “The landscape here is no different than it was in the time of the prophets and Jesus,” Oz said along the way. The hills are bare, but there are wolves, desert hares, jackals. There are Bedouin camps, oases. Oz takes his walks here to clear his mind of the latest news from Jerusalem and Gaza, to “keep perspective on eternity.”\n\n\n\nNily, who has oil-black hair and a wit that is occasionally aimed at the household star, smiles patiently as Amos makes observations that she has undoubtedly heard a hundred times. Amos and Nily met as teen-agers on the kibbutz and have been married for forty-four years. Their children are grown and the distractions are few. On the drive, they showed me the oasis where their grandchildren go camping and ride camels when they visit from the suburbs of Tel Aviv and Haifa. We passed a few archeological signs, Biblical sites. As if on cue, we passed a Bedouin camp, a goat, a camel, the desert tourist’s equivalent of the Empire State Building.\n\n\n\n“Amos,” Nily said, tiring of the tour, “let’s make sure we get back for a walk. The sun is getting low.”\n\n\n\nOz stopped the car and, without fear of oncoming traffic, animal or automotive, swung back toward town.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nLast year, Oz published a memoir called “Sipour Al Ahava Vehoshekh”—“A Tale of Love and Darkness.” (It is one of the biggest-selling literary works in Israeli history; Nicholas de Lange’s English translation will be published this month by Harcourt.) For many years, Oz has drawn on the facts and landscapes of his life for his novels. What made “A Tale of Love and Darkness” an event is the power with which it entwines the intimate story of an immigrant family—a lonely, depressed mother, a distant father, and their son—with the larger historical story: Europe’s rejection, the frantic search for refuge among Arabs in Palestine, the idealism and the disappointments, the establishment of Israel and the war that followed. Amos is a precocious, secretive boy, a “ceaseless, tireless talker,” confused by overheard news of death camps abroad and civil war at home; he is a boy who plots the history of a new country with toy soldiers and maps spread across the kitchen floor. The book is a digressive, ingenious work that circles around the rise of a state, the tragic destiny of a mother, a boy’s creation of a new self. “I was, if you wish, the Tom Sawyer or Huckleberry Finn of history,” Oz said. “To me it was like sailing alone on a raft on the Mississippi River, except it was a river made of books and words and stories and historical tales and secrets and separations.”\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a novel like Philip Roth’s “American Pastoral,” history seems to assault the characters, wreaking havoc on a desire for tranquillity; it arrives as a shock. That has never been possible in Oz’s part of the world, where war and ethnic tension have been constants. “I know that for people in the West history is something that comes across the television screen,” he said. “This whole book is saturated with history. It is not a piece of tragic chamber music played against a wide screen.”\n\n\n\nOz’s eldest child, his daughter Fania, teaches history at Haifa University. She told me that “A Tale of Love and Darkness” should be read, in part, as an argument about the history of Zionism. The book, she said, portrays Zionism and the creation of Israel as a historical necessity for a people faced with the threat of extinction. It acknowledges the original sin of Israel—the displacement and the suffering of the Palestinians—but, at the same time, defends Zionism against some on the European left and among the Israeli New Historians who challenge the state’s claim to legitimacy even now, almost six decades after its founding. As Amos, Nily, and I were driving from the desert valleys to an area closer to town where we could take a walk at sunset, I mentioned his daughter’s idea.\n\n\n\nOz quickly glanced back over his shoulder. “If there had been no Zionism, six and a half million would have been dead rather than six million, and who would have cared?” he said. “Israel was a life raft for a half-million Jews.”\n\n\n\nI said that some American, European, and Israeli intellectuals were now saying that the Zionist project was lost, and that the only future was bi-national, a state of both Arabs and Jews from the Mediterranean to the Jordan River—a state that would, given the realities of borders and birth rates, become majority Arab quite fast. Had Zionism, as it was conceived by his parents’ generation, been a mistake?\n\n\n\n“I don’t think there was any real practical choice,” Oz said. “When anti-Semitism in Europe became unbearable, Jews might have preferred to go to the United States, but they had no chance in hell in the thirties of being admitted to America.” One of his grandfathers, in Lithuania, applied for French, British, and Scandinavian visas—and he was rejected every time. “It was so desperate that he even applied for German citizenship, eighteen months before Hitler came to power,” Oz said. “Fortunately for me, he was turned down. The Jews had nowhere to go, and this is difficult to convey today. People now ask, Was it good to come here? Was it a mistake? Was Zionism a reasonable project? There was no place else. There was a conference in Evian”—in 1938—“where the problem of the Jewish refugees and the Nazi persecutions was discussed. It ended with practically just the Dominican Republic expressing its readiness to accept one or two thousand Jews, and a couple of other countries. The Prime Minister of Australia said, In Australia we have no problem of anti-Semitism, thank God. But we don’t want to encourage more Jews to come here. Otherwise, we might have anti-Semitism.” It was a time, as Chaim Weizmann, who became the first President of Israel, described it, when “the world seemed to be divided into two parts—those places where the Jews could not live and those where they could not enter.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nOz parked the car at a curb that marked the end of Arad and the start of the desert. We got out and looked into a long drop. Amos and Nily walked hand in hand down a path that led to a huge, martial-seeming piece of sculpture.\n\n\n\n\n\n“I don’t know what we did to deserve this lovely thing,” Nily said as we approached it. She rolled her eyes and smiled.\n\n\n\nWe did not hike far. Nily was wearing a long black cotton dress, and a sharp breeze had come up suddenly.\n\n\n\nAmos wanted to catch sight of the sun setting, and it was now at our backs. We turned around and started toward the town. A few Ethiopian men were sitting on the curb and sharing a large bottle of beer.\n\n\n\n“Do you know what ‘Addis Ababa’ means?”\n\n\n\nOz knows a great deal. Nily is patient with this.\n\n\n\n“What does ‘Addis Ababa’ mean?” she said sweetly.\n\n\n\nThe men glanced over and smiled, catching the drift.\n\n\n\nNily held up her hand and stopped us.\n\n\n\n“Look down, look _here_,” she said, pointing at a spot along the trail. “Ants.”\n\n\n\n“A society of ants,” Amos said. “Let’s skip the metaphors. And watch.”\n\n\n\nThey bent over and watched with the rapt fascination of a couple on safari.\n\n\n\nThe sun was pulsing orange and just inches from the horizon.\n\n\n\nNily smiled as Amos stood behind her and held her close. “I am glad to be alive,” she said.\n\n\n\nAmos waited awhile. It was darker, but it was not dark yet. He looked up. “I’m hungry,” he said and headed to the car.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nA few minutes later, we pulled up to a clump of low-slung commercial enterprises on the edge of town.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Welcome to Mr. Shay’s,” Nily said. “The best Chinese restaurant in the Negev.”\n\n\n\nMr. Shay, a Thai who had somehow come to Arad and married an Israeli, greeted us at our table. We were the only diners. I was concerned. But Mr. Shay turned out to be a fine cook and, though he is said to prepare a mean “kosher crab,” I ordered the chicken.\n\n\n\nWe talked for a while about “A Tale of Love and Darkness.” Much of it is clearly the result of memory and memory reconstructed from reading and conversations with older relatives. There are long excavations of Oz’s origins, the lives of his grandparents and parents in Europe, a lost world of high culture, Jewish learning, ferocious anti-Semitism. Using the evidence, but also the liberties of a novelist, Oz tries to portray things as hidden to him as his father’s love affairs and his mother’s tortured inner life.\n\n\n\n“I don’t like to be described as an author of fiction,” he said. “Fiction is a lie. James Joyce took the trouble, if I am not mistaken, to measure the precise distance from Bloom’s basement entrance to the street above. In ‘Ulysses’ it is exact, and yet it is called fiction. But when a journalist writes, ‘A cloud of uncertainty hovers . . .’—this is called fact!”\n\n\n\n“A Tale of Love and Darkness” ultimately amounts to the founding story of Israel as told through a child’s eyes—a kind of Zionist “What Maisie Knew.” At a time when Zionism is under question, the book provides a dramatic, yet liberal justification for Israel’s existence. Oz said that, while the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians is between “right and right”—between two legitimate claims demanding a decent and equitable divorce—what has been lost over time is the desperate conditions that preceded Israel’s founding. Oz can only tell it as a story:\n\n\n\n“The mother of the man who married my elder daughter is an unusual Holocaust survivor. She was taken from Holland with her mother and sister to Ravensbrück, a concentration camp, where the mother died. The two girls were nineteen and eighteen. At Ravensbrück, the girls heard stories about Auschwitz from detainees who had been there but were not sent to their death because they came from mixed marriages. Then something happened that I think was unique in the history of the Holocaust. The foreign ministry in Berlin gave an order saying, Send those two girls to Theresienstadt. There they were introduced to Adolf Eichmann, and he and several S.S. commanders interrogated them. Eichmann asked what they knew about Auschwitz. He said, ‘If you ever say a word about your life in Ravensbrück or what you know about Auschwitz, you, too, will go up in those chimneys.’ At Theresienstadt, they were given work. Twice during the war, Eichmann saw those two girls.\n\n\n\n“As it turned out, this woman grew up and was one of the witnesses at the Eichmann trial”—in Jerusalem in the early nineteen-sixties. “It was hard for her to testify. At the trial, Eichmann tried to say that he was just a cog in the wheel, that he hadn’t even the capacity to decide on one life. I am telling you this story because, despite Eichmann’s warning to the two sisters about being quiet, they did tell everyone they could in Theresienstadt. They talked about Auschwitz and the gas chambers, but not one person at Theresientadt believed them. They were called hysterical. So: how could people in Jerusalem or New York believe something that even the inmates of Theresienstadt refused to believe? Knowing is one thing. Believing another. Understanding another.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nA few years ago, I tried to arrange a meeting with Oz in Jerusalem. He demurred, seeming to prefer almost any other place: Arad, or the apartment in Tel Aviv that he and Nily bought in order to spend weekends near their grandchildren. Now he said, “I don’t often spend the night in Jerusalem. I’ll go professionally or to see friends. It is hyperactive. Everyone is expecting something, either the messiah or disaster or both. Tel Aviv is becoming more and more Mediterranean, like the South of France, whereas Jerusalem is moving in the direction of, I don’t know where, maybe like Qum, in Iran.”\n\n\n\n\n\nOz was born Amos Klausner in Jerusalem in 1939. His parents, Yehuda Arieh and Fania, came from Eastern Europe, in the nineteen-thirties, speaking Yiddish, Russian, Ukrainian, and German. In Jerusalem, they spoke Hebrew with their son, Russian when there were secrets to keep. In those days, Palestine was predominantly Arab. Jerusalem was not. Except in the era of the Crusades, in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, there had been a continuous Jewish presence in the city. When Amos was born, the population was small—around a hundred thousand—and each neighborhood was distinct. The Klausners would walk from their basement apartment, on Amos Street, in Kerem Avraham, to see their more distinguished relatives in the neighborhood of Talpiot, and, Oz said, “it was in the same spirit that shtetl Jews would take the train to Warsaw to see the five-story buildings.”\n\n\n\nOne morning, I met Oz at a hotel on the outskirts of the city, and we took a cab to Malchai Yisroel—Kings of Israel Street. Kerem Avraham, along with the neighboring enclaves of Geula and Mea Shearim, is almost completely Orthodox. Signs announced the opening of a new kosher butcher shop, the lecture schedules of prominent rabbis, a clothing store “for modest women.” Oz pointed out an enormous walled-off compound that had first been an orphanage and then, after the British conquered Palestine, in 1917, was converted into the Schneller Barracks. The Schneller Barracks are a presence, the embodiment of the British Mandate, in many of Oz’s stories and novels. When he was a boy, he and his friends used to take gum from the British soldiers and then turn around and shout “Nazi!” and throw stones.\n\n\n\n“Imagine!” he said now. “This was one or two years after the British had been at war with the real thing.” When Oz was seven, the Stern Gang, a Jewish terror organization, exploded a car bomb outside the barracks. “How I admired them for that!” he said in the same tone of self-mockery.\n\n\n\nThe day was brutally hot. Though the blocks are well-planted with cypress and Jerusalem pine, today the trees seemed limp and singed.\n\n\n\nIn many neighborhoods of the city, Jews live in houses that were expropriated from Arab families during the war of 1948, what Jewish Israelis call the War of Independence and Palestinians call the _nakba_, the catastrophe. With some relief, Oz said that Kerem Avraham was built on land bought by an English missionary, James Finn, who had the novel idea of a place where Jews could start a farm.\n\n\n\nThe overwhelming emotion in “A Tale of Love and Darkness” is of loss. Even Zionism itself felt, at that time, like a form of loss—the loss of a European culture that had rejected, and was now murdering, Jews. “Everyone in Jerusalem—Jewish Jerusalem—of those days missed something,” Oz had said earlier. “Other places, other cultures, other languages, other people. It was, for most Jews, an exile, a refugee camp. But at the same time it was also a magnet for all sorts of lunatics, redeemers, world reformers, and self-fashioned messiahs. In this respect, it hasn’t changed much; perhaps it is even more so. Everyone who had a way to salvage the Jewish people in three easy moves came to Jerusalem. It was full of prophets, bookbinders who prophesied, cashiers who prophesied, scholars who prophesied. And this was very exciting for a child, because every fantasy that I could summon in my little mind I could find someone who would endorse my fantasy and say, ‘Yes, yes, this little boy has a vision, he knows even better than Ben-Gurion.’ ”\n\n\n\nWe came to No. 18 Amos Street, a modest apartment block with a tiny hardware store in the center of what had been the apartment of one small family: the Klausners.\n\n\n\n“It’s more run-down than it used to be,” Oz said as we climbed a few steps and looked at a small back garden. There had been fig trees, radishes, green onions, eggplants. Now little other than some scrubby grass seemed to grow.\n\n\n\n“If you look at this spot here,” Oz went on, smiling a bit strangely, “here is where my friends and I worked day after day, when we were all about seven, trying to build a rocket that we would aim and fire at Buckingham Palace. There was a problem with the fuel and the guidance system.” When he was not plotting the overthrow of King George VI, Oz wrote what he calls “Biblical poems about the restoration of the Davidic kingdom through blood and fire.” His father had studied literature and history in Vilna and Jerusalem and could read in sixteen languages, though he never found a teaching berth. He made his living as a librarian and, at night, wrote books and articles about comparative literature. On the Sabbath, Fania stayed inside alone, reading—Chekhov, Tolstoy, Kleist, Hamsun, Maupassant, Agnon, Flaubert—and the men would sit in the yard “discussing the problems of Bakunin and Nechayev and whether the German social democrats were too soft.” Politics was the constant conversation, and nearly all the adults in the Klausner circle were right-wing Revisionists, suspicious of the Labor Zionists and their socialist dreams.\n\n\n\n“The remarkable thing is that those people were not fascists,” Oz said. “In their own view, they rejected any racist notion. They just happened to maintain that the Arab nation has a land mass three times as big as Europe, whereas the Jewish people have nothing, and that even if Greater Israel is given to the Jews and the Arabs are forced to migrate, that would mean for the Arabs a loss of zero point five per cent of the Arab homeland. I am only trying to explain their view. . . . So yes, this Klausner environment was very right-wing, very militaristic, intoxicated by the fact that Jews can fight, and fight well. Thrilled by it in a childish way. Remember, this is two years after the Holocaust. In those years, the Jews were never accused of being bullies or thugs; they were accused of being cowards who hide and will not fight back.”\n\n\n\nOz looked in a window of his old apartment. The shades were drawn. When he lived there, every room, kitchen and bathroom included, was lined with books, and, among the books, there were small landscapes of Europe cut from magazines: lakes, forests, snow-capped mountains. “For years, throughout my childhood, my father and others would say to me, ‘One day, Amos, not in our lifetime but in yours, this Jerusalem is going to evolve and become a real city,’ ” he said. “I didn’t know what they were talking about. To me, Jerusalem was the only real city in the world. Europe was a myth.\n\n\n\n“And yet deep down there was this longing and yearning. You walked in Rehavia, a kind of German-Jewish, fairly wealthy neighborhood of Jerusalem, you walked there on Saturday at siesta time, when the streets were absolutely empty, and you would hear from many windows the sound of pianos. They were all craving Europe, whether it was Chopin or Mozart or Brahms.”\n\n\n\nBy the end of the Second World War, expectations about the founding of a Jewish state were intense: “We were in the corridor of the maternity ward, we were like the nervous parents waiting for what was happening beyond the door.” One Hanukkah, as Oz’s father lit the candles, he told his only child that, one day, “not in my lifetime but in yours,” as many as a million Jews would live in the country: “It sounded like science fiction, a futuristic, wild speculation.”\n\n\n\nWhat came next, of course, is the diplomatic and military history of 1947-1948: the United Nations declarations of two-state partition on November 29, 1947, and then the war that followed—Egypt, Syria, Transjordan, Lebanon, and Iraq on one side, the newly declared state of Israel on the other.\n\n\n\nIn his journalism and essays, in books like “The Land of Israel” and “Under This Blazing Light,” Oz harbors no illusions about the nature of that war—least of all about the displacement of more than seven hundred thousand Palestinian Arabs from their villages and cities and about their lives of misery in refugee camps throughout the region. At the same time, he argues, the Arabs were “under no obligation” to start a war after the U.N. partition plan. But in “A Tale of Love and Darkness” the narrator is not a disinterested historian; the point of view is that of a young boy seeing what he could see, listening to the broadcasts and speeches and rumors all around him. He describes collecting empty bottles to make Molotov cocktails, the suspension of school for an entire year, the rumor around the neighborhood that some families had fled the country and that one had stashed cyanide tablets “just in case.”\n\n\n\n“All of the Holocaust survivors had seen all this before, from the last weeks of August in 1939,” Oz said about the first days of war. “The big change came on May 14th, with the expiration of the British Mandate. That Friday morning, I saw with my eyes the British leaving the Schneller Barracks and then the Haganah”—the new Israeli Army—“rushing to take over. Then, on Friday afternoon, we were told that Israel is a nation now, it has a government, but one minute after midnight we were told that Israel is being invaded by five regular Arab armies, and that there was shelling and bombardment by artillery batteries. There was nowhere to send the kids, nowhere to go.” For years, in Europe, Oz’s father had seen graffiti in German and Russian and Ukrainian: “Jews Go Home to Palestine.” Years later, as a citizen of Israel, he saw new signs: “Jews Out of Palestine.”\n\n\n\nAt one point in the memoir, Oz writes that as a child he hoped to “grow up to be a book.” When I asked him about it, he smiled and said, “There was fear when I was a little boy. People would say, Enjoy every day, because not every child grows up to be a person.This was probably their way of telling me about the Holocaust or the frame of Jewish history. Not every child grows up. I know the Israelis become tiresome when they say that the whole world is against us, but back in the forties this was pretty much the case. I wanted to become a book, not a man. The house was full of books written by dead men, and I thought a book may survive.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nFania’s father had owned a mill in Rovno, in western Ukraine, and came with his family to Haifa, in 1934, to work as a carter on the docks. In the book, Oz describes his mother’s knowledge, in the mid-forties, that, on the outskirts of Rovno, in the Sosenki Forest, “among boughs, birds, mushrooms, currants, and berries,” the Nazis had slaughtered more than twenty thousand Jews, with submachine guns, in two days.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven as a young boy, as he makes clear in “A Tale of Love and Darkness,” Oz was keenly aware that his mother was adrift and that relations between his parents had eroded. Fania became increasingly depressed, withdrawn. “Among the immediate reasons for my mother’s decline was the weight of history, the personal insult, the traumas, and the fears for the future,” Oz said. “My mother had premonitions all the time, probably because of the trauma of the Holocaust. She might have sensed that what happened to the Jews in her home town would sooner or later happen here, that there would be a total massacre. This is not something she would share with a little boy, except perhaps obliquely, through some of the stories and fairy tales she told, the books she read, a hair-raising Schopenhauerian world view.”\n\n\n\nBy the end of 1951, Fania’s black periods had become worse and more frequent. Amos and his father were, he writes, “like a pair of stretcher bearers carrying an injured person up a steep slope.” In “A Tale of Love and Darkness,” the reader knows early on that Fania is doomed, and at the end of the book, as she wanders the streets of Tel Aviv in a downpour and, finally, takes her life with an overdose of sedatives, it is possible to get some sense of the son’s loss and fury.\n\n\n\nOnly now, after reaching an age when he is old enough to be the father of his lost mother, Oz told me, can he look at those days with a certain detachment.\n\n\n\nFania Klausner killed herself in January, 1952, Oz said, for countless reasons: “She died because, for her, Jerusalem was an exile. This climate and environment and reality was alien. And she died because her hopes, if she had any, that maybe a replica of her Europe could be built here, without the bad aspects of the Diaspora Jewish shtetl, were apparently refuted by the reality of the morning after.” Fania was just thirty-eight years old.\n\n\n\n“After my mother died, my father and I never talked about her,” he said. “We never mentioned her name, not once. If we referred to her at all, it was as ‘she’ and ‘her.’ We had plenty of discussions, political discussions—he thought I was a Red—but never about her.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nWe were soon on Ben Yehuda Street, a pedestrian arcade lined with cafés, restaurants, bookshops, and trinket stores for tourists. The area around Ben Yehuda, one of the most crowded spots in Jerusalem, has been a popular site for suicide bombers.\n\n\n\n\n\nOz had not been back to his old neighborhood for a few years, and he was uncharacteristically quiet as we walked. Suddenly, he ducked into an alley, headed up a small set of steps, and then went looking for a favorite café.\n\n\n\n“It’s here somewhere,” he said. “It’s right . . . over . . . yes! . . . Here.”\n\n\n\nThe sign read “Tmol Shilshom”— “The Day Before Yesterday”—the title of a novel by S. Y. Agnon. In Oz’s youth, Agnon was the singular literary presence in Jerusalem, an immigrant from Galicia, who wrote in Hebrew and, in 1966, won the Nobel Prize.\n\n\n\nOz mopped his brow and ordered a cold drink. Our walk through Kerem Avraham had been a kind of exercise, a performance on request—the writer come home to the scene of the book, the scene of the crime. Oz seemed drained by it.\n\n\n\n“We’ve just visited a place that no longer exists,” he said. At least, not as it was in the life and books of Amos Oz. “When I visited Oxford, Mississippi, I had to run back to Faulkner’s novels. The place was a fading reproduction of the real thing.” Nearly half of Oz’s books—among them “Where the Jackals Howl,” “My Michael,” “The Hill of Evil Counsel,” “The Same Sea,” and now “A Tale of Love and Darkness”—take place in one square mile of Kerem Avraham.\n\n\n\nAs a writer and as a teacher—he is a professor of literature at Ben-Gurion University, in Be’er Sheva—Oz says he is a committed “provincial.” He is hardly ignorant of other literatures, but he is obsessed primarily with the storytellers, essayists, and poets who wrote in modern Hebrew and gave shape to cultural Zionism.\n\n\n\n“Both of my parents knew Hebrew before they arrived in Palestine,” he said. “They knew Yiddish, but Yiddish for them was shtetl talk, the talk of the previous generation, and so not to speak it was part of their rebellion against their own ancestors. For my mother, Yiddish was the language in which her parents quarrelled. The Hebrew of my childhood was a language making its first steps in the open, like a creature bred and created in a laboratory or in a zoo and set free.”\n\n\n\nAfter seventeen centuries of near-dormancy, Hebrew was revived as a modern instrument by a small clutch of nationalists in Europe in the late nineteenth century. “There is a myth, according to which Hebrew was revived for ideological reasons by a genius of a madman, or a madman of a genius, called Eliezer Ben Yehuda, who reinvented Hebrew and invented thousands of words—and all of it is true,” Oz said. “This is at the turn of the century here in Jerusalem. But, of course, not even a genius could persuade Norwegians to speak Korean one fine morning or Greeks to speak Portuguese. So what actually happened? In the last decade of the nineteenth century, with the growing influx of European Jews coming into Jerusalem, most of them not Zionists but ultra-Orthodox, who came for religious reasons, to get buried on the Mount of Olives—when they confronted the local indigenous Jewish population, the Sephardic population, there was no common language. The only way to ask directions to the Wailing Wall or to rent an apartment in the Old City was to resort to prayer-book Hebrew. If, a hundred years ago, you put on a desert island one thousand churchgoing Catholic French people and one thousand churchgoing Lithuanians, Latin would have been revived for the same reasons.”\n\n\n\nIn addition, since the eighteenth century there had been writers who wrote in what most of the world considered a dead language: Chaim Nachman Bialik, Yosef Chaim Brenner, Micha Berdichevsky, and, later on, S. Y. Agnon. When Oz travels in Europe and the United States, giving readings and speeches, most audiences want to talk about current events, not literary influences, and, even for many Jewish audiences, Agnon and the rest of Oz’s literary reference points are unfamiliar. It’s as if Gabriel García Márquez’s readers had never heard of Cervantes. “Agnon is an imagination on the level of Robert Musil and Hermann Broch,” Oz said. “Why did he stick to Hebrew? Even if he had written in Yiddish there would have been a larger audience. Here is a writer who wrote realistic, mimetic novels in a language that no one really spoke. Part of it was probably ideology, neo-Zionism. Those writers were mesmerized by the beauty of Hebrew as a musical instrument, and there was also the nineteenth-century Romanticism—1848, the springtime of nations—and the interest in folklore, back to origins. This was going on all over Europe.”\n\n\n\nThe renaissance of Hebrew is the most unqualified success of cultural Zionism. Ten thousand people spoke it at the turn of the century, three hundred thousand in the nineteen-forties, seven or eight million today. “This is more than the speakers of Danish worldwide,” Oz said. “And more than the number of speakers of English in the days of William Shakespeare. So this is the big story of my life, more even than creating a state or drying the swamps or winning some victories on the battlefield.”\n\n\n\nCuriously, Oz has relatively little affinity for the Jewish-American novelists of his generation. He has read Bellow, Malamud, and Roth, and he is fully aware that some of his relatives had intended to make New York, and not Jerusalem, their promised land, and yet he seems not merely indifferent to those writers but even haughtily dismissive of their work and their subjects.\n\n\n\n“Tongue in cheek, I can imagine myself having ended up as one of the Jewish-American writers of Russian background writing mostly about the neuroses of immigrants and their offspring,” he said. “This probably would be my subject. I wouldn’t be writing about the desert or the starry nights of the country. To some extent, as a reader I have some problems—and this is not a professional category and I wouldn’t use it in my capacity as a professor of literature in the classroom—I have a certain problem with indoors literature. . . . So much of what I have to tell has to do with the open, the desert, the field, a kind of arid mountains around Jerusalem, the neighborhoods, the street, the garden, the kibbutz. I would feel claustrophobic.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nKibbutz Hulda, which grew over time to cover twenty-four hundred acres, lies just south of the road between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Jewish pioneers bought the land in 1904 from an Arab landlord, and in 1931 a group of young Zionists, who were followers of A. D. Gordon, a Tolstoyan visionary from Ukraine, established the kibbutz. Amos left home for Hulda when he was fourteen. He changed his name from Klausner to Oz, a Hebrew word for “strength,” though when he arrived at Hulda he was hardly in possession of that. He was pale, weak, confused.\n\n\n\n\n\n“The funny thing is, my new life was not far below the grain of my father’s expectations, for the idea was always transmitted to me that you will have to be completely different,” Oz said. “You will have to be simple, uncomplicated tractor drivers and soldiers.”\n\n\n\nI asked Oz why he didn’t just run away to Tel Aviv, to the secular night life, to hedonism or books—anywhere but a place where the workday began at four in the morning.\n\n\n\n“Tel Aviv was not radical enough—only the kibbutz was radical enough,” he said. “The joke of it is that what I found at the kibbutz was the same Jewish shtetl, milking cows and talking about Kropotkin at the same time and disagreeing about Trotsky in a Talmudic way, picking apples and having a fierce disagreement about Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht. It was a bit of a nightmare. Every morning you would wake up and you were in the same place! I was a disaster as a laborer. I became the joke of the kibbutz.”\n\n\n\nThe other young people were already accustomed to the kibbutz life: the way children lived apart from their parents in a kind of barracks-dorm, the free and easy sexual life of the teen-agers. “It was an old story: I was an Eastern European Jewish boy trying to assimilate into a society that had its accepted codes, even a particular set of accents and body language,” Oz said. “It was a teen-age ‘Lord of the Flies,’ with better weather and a sensual permissiveness.”\n\n\n\nWe pulled off the highway and headed down a road toward Hulda. In the nineteen-fifties and sixties, Israel’s communal farms were a khaki-colored banner of the Zionist project, its hardiness, its soft semi-socialism—though even then the kibbutzniks made up only four per cent of the Israeli population. (Now it’s less than two per cent.) By the nineteen-eighties, young people were moving away from the kibbutz, rebelling against their earnest, idealist parents. The life was too hard, too plain. They grew tired of the lack of privacy, they wanted their share of the new proto-American consumerism in the cities.\n\n\n\nOur first stop was a small graveyard shrouded by pines.\n\n\n\n“Two-thirds of all my characters are here in this graveyard,” Oz said.\n\n\n\nAs we walked, he pointed out one familiar grave after another: Pinchas Lavon, a minister of defense. The Zuckermans, Nily’s parents. A pair of friends. An intellectual dandy known as “the Count” who argued philosophy and made his own wine. Then a row of twenty identical graves, all young men killed in battle on a single day in 1948. In the origins of those men, Oz said, was the story of the early state, and he read them as he walked along the row of flat stone markers: “Born in Poland. Born in Tripoli. Born in Russia. In Tel Aviv. Gaza. Czechoslovakia.” After reading them all, he lingered awhile, and then he said, “Many here died in Israel without ever having lived in it, really. They came to Israel, and, within three weeks of independence, they died in battle.”\n\n\n\nWe stopped at the grave of a young man who had been a student of his when he taught literature in the kibbutz school: “Died in the 1967 war.” Then a four-year-old child, dead of drowning.\n\n\n\n“I knew all these people, who hated whom, who loved whom, who was cheating with whom,” Oz said. “It’s an extended-family cemetery. We’ll be buried here, too.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nIt was late morning, and most of the adults were working in the fields and the vineyards. The sun hammered down hard and the air was full of dust and everywhere was the smell of cow shit and hay. There are more than fifty buildings on the grounds. As the population has thinned, some of the buildings have been abandoned. We stopped by the low-slung concrete bungalow where Amos and Nily lived when they were first married. Kibbutz socialism was infinitely gentler than its East German cousin, but the architecture was just as brutal. The apartment was smaller than a freshman-dorm room. Oz smiled as he knocked on the door. In contrast with seeing the house on Amos Street, revisiting this place seemed to bring him pleasure. Oz wrote “My Michael” in the tiny bathroom. “I sat up smoking all night, sitting there with the toilet seat down, and a pad of paper and a book on my knees, writing,” he said. “I wanted to become a simple, dumb tractor driver. But I began to write secretly. I couldn’t resist it.”\n\n\n\n\n\nA rangy young man, shirtless, sipping a bottle of beer, let us in. He recognized the face.\n\n\n\n“Amos Oz?” he said.\n\n\n\n“The same,” Oz said.\n\n\n\nThe young man smiled and showed us around—all four corners of the room. Oz inspected the corners carefully, joyfully, as if he were going to find his younger self under the mattress, behind the dust balls. Finally, he thanked his inheritor-tenant, stepped outside, and pointed to a large pecan tree.\n\n\n\n“I planted it when my older daughter was born,” he said.\n\n\n\nWe walked around the farm: to an abandoned arms depot; to the “children’s republic,” with a jungle gym, a school, and the long barracks where the children slept; and on to the dining hall, where Oz worked Saturdays as a waiter (“the fastest on the kibbutz”). The buildings have slouched, peeled, gone to seed. Across Israel it is widely speculated that, in a generation or so, there will be no more kibbutzim; the land will be turned into private farms or suburban developments.\n\n\n\n“In a sense, the kibbutz left some of its genes in the entire Israeli civilization, even people who never lived on a kibbutz and rejected the kibbutz idea,” Oz said. “You look at the West Bank settlers—not my favorite people, as you can imagine. You will see kibbutz genes in their conduct and even their outward appearance. If you see the directness of Israelis, the almost latent anarchism, the skepticism, the lack of an in-built class hierarchy between the taxi-driver and the passenger—all of those are very much the kibbutz legacy, and it’s a good legacy. So, in a strange way, the kibbutz, like some bygone stars, still provides us with light long after it’s been extinguished.”\n\n\n\nWhen Oz began publishing his first stories and asked for time off from his farming work to write, there was an intense debate among the elders: “Who is he, at twenty-four, to declare himself a writer? What if everyone calls himself an artist? Who will milk the cows and plow the land?”\n\n\n\nFinally, after long discussion, Oz was given one day a week to write. (He taught for two days and spent three days in the fields.) With each book or so, he got an extra day to write. When “My Michael” became a best-seller, Oz continued the socialist practices of the kibbutz. “I became a branch of the farm, yet they still said I could have just three days a week to write,” he recalled. “It was only in the eighties when I got four days for my writing, two days for teaching, and Saturday turns as a waiter in the dining hall.”\n\n\n\nAlthough their children never liked the kibbutz, Amos and Nily stayed on long past the peak years. But in the mid-eighties doctors told them that their third child, Daniel, was suffering from acute asthma and needed a change of climate. Arad has probably the cleanest, driest air in the country—“an asthmatic’s mecca,” Oz calls it—and the family moved there in 1986. “What kept me in the kibbutz was personal friendships, loyalty, also a certain sense that I didn’t want to defect from a sinking boat,” he said.\n\n\n\nIn “A Tale of Love and Darkness,” in his novels, and in conversation, there is little about his years on the kibbutz that Oz does not confront: the initial loneliness, the cramped atmosphere of labor and gossip and sex and dreams, the sense of living out a set of ideals and then seeing those ideals run down, fade. And yet there is almost no mention of his participation in the true Israeli universal: the Army. In the late fifties, in the regular Army, he was part of a kibbutz-oriented unit called Nahal, and he was involved in skirmishes along the Syrian border. During the 1967 war, he served with a tank unit in Sinai; during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, when Israel nearly lost to the combined forces of Syria and Egypt, he was with a unit in the Golan Heights, on the Syrian border.\n\n\n\n“It is difficult for me, either in an interview or in a book, to talk about the experience of fighting,” he said. “I have never written about the battlefield, because I don’t think I could convey the experience of fighting to people who have not been on the battlefield. Battle consists first and foremost of a horrible stench. The battlefield stinks to high heaven. It’s hard to imagine the stench. This doesn’t come across even in Tolstoy or Hemingway or Remarque. This stifling mixture of burning rubber and burning metal and burning human flesh and feces, everything burning. A description of the battlefield that does not contain the stench and the fear is not sufficient. It is where everyone around you has shit their pants.” At one point, he talked about how he and his fellow-soldiers thought for two or three days during the 1973 war that they would not live through the fighting and that Israel would be destroyed. “But I don’t think I can describe that without resorting to clichés,” he said. “I tried writing about it a couple of times a long time ago. I destroyed the drafts when I realized that language, at least mine, could not contain this experience. I could write about sex, I could write about the kibbutz, about envy, about sunsets, about howling jackals. Not this.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nIn the nineties, when Shimon Peres was thinking about retiring from the leadership of the Labor Party, he said that he could imagine three inheritors: Ehud Barak (who eventually became Prime Minister), Shlomo Ben-Ami (who became Barak’s foreign minister), and Amos Oz.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Ever since I was a little boy, I’ve been running this country in my head, and I do this today,” Oz said. “I know what to do better than the Prime Ministers.” Then he smiled and became appropriately modest. “If I look at history, I know what to do, but this doesn’t mean I can be Prime Minister. I know one or two things that Shimon doesn’t, but I have a physical disability: I cannot pronounce the words ‘No comment.’ How can I be a politician?”\n\n\n\nOz is an ardent admirer of Václav Havel. He may even envy the way Havel, a political artist, was suddenly thrust into the role of statesman-visionary, becoming the first democratically elected President to govern in Prague since the rise of Communism. Oz emerged as a political actor just two months after the end of the 1967 war. He was twenty-eight, an obscure writer on a small kibbutz, but he had the nerve to send an article called “Land of the Forefathers” to the Labor newspaper, _Davar_, calling for the government to begin negotiations immediately with the Palestinians over the West Bank and Gaza. Like very few others at this moment of national exaltation, Oz gloomily forecast moral and political disaster should Israel retain the territories. “Even unavoidable occupation is a corrupting occupation,” he wrote.\n\n\n\nSupport for a two-state solution—for an end to occupation and for a secure division of Israel and Palestine—is now a near-consensus position in Israel. Even Ariel Sharon, who is now acting to dismantle the Gaza settlements, concedes as much. But in 1967, as people around the world celebrated “tiny Israel’s” triumph, as tourists from abroad began to flock to the liberated Western Wall, that position was considered off-the-board radical. At the kibbutz, Oz had clearly abandoned his right-wing Revisionist upbringing for a far more liberal politics, but even at Hulda he did not encounter unanimous agreement. Some demanded that he be fired from his teaching. His children were mocked in school. There were nasty letters in the right-wing press: “betrayal,” “collaborator with the deadly enemies of Israel,” candidate for the local Judenrat. I asked him how he came to take such a bold public position at such an early moment.\n\n\n\n“It was my imagination,” he said. “I couldn’t help thinking of my own childhood under the British in Jerusalem. As a child, I had nightmares—genetic, family nightmares—of uniformed aliens coming to our little street to kill us: the British, the Arabs, the Romans, tsarist soldiers, anyone from the long Jewish martyrology. My father bowed to the uniformed British, the same reaction he had in Lithuania. In 1967, suddenly I was the uniformed alien. I was in the West Bank in uniform with a submachine gun released for reserve service, and those Palestinian kids were willing to kiss my hand for chewing gum.”\n\n\n\nAfter the Yom Kippur War, advocates of the two-state solution were no longer considered members of the Flat Earth Society, and, in 1978, Oz, along with many other liberal activists and former Army officers and reservists, created the grassroots movement called Shalom Achshav—Peace Now. Most of his activism has taken the form of editorial writing. He has written countless columns, first for _Davar_, and then, when _Davar_ folded, a decade ago, for the tabloid daily _Yediot Achronot_. Although his positions are invariably left-wing, he seldom writes for the most élite left-wing paper, _Ha’aretz_. “In my political articles, I think of my audience as Edith Bunker,” he said. “I can never convince Archie Bunker. He is beyond me.”\n\n\n\nOz believes (as the pollsters do) that both the Israeli and the Palestinian publics support a two-state solution—a realistic, “clenched-teeth compromise”—but that neither Sharon nor the ailing Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, has the courage to carry the process to its conclusion. (“The patients are ready for the operation, but the surgeons are cowards,” he says.) That is now fairly conventional wisdom, at least in moderate and liberal circles. What Oz adds to the political debate is an emotional, imaginative dimension. Dreamily (but aware of it), Oz tries to envisage a series of improbable gestures that would break the deadlock: “Suppose Sharon gave a Sadat-style speech to the Palestinian National Assembly expressing empathy, saying we’ll do anything to heal the Palestinian wounds short of committing suicide, saying it will be hard but you will have an independent state with a share of Jerusalem. Suppose he said it on the anniversary of the massacre of Palestinians at Deir Yassin. Can you imagine the earthquake? And suppose Arafat went on Palestinian television and said that after a hundred years of bloody wars I finally realize that this is the Jewish national home, too. We need a two-state solution. Can you imagine? I realize this is not a likely scenario, but this is what was missing in the nineties. Imagine the reverberations in every Palestinian refugee camp and the entire Muslim world. But no one is ready to do it.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThe four leading novelists in Israel—Oz, Aharon Appelfeld, A. B. Yehoshua, and David Grossman—are all on the political left, supporters of a Palestinian state, but they are distinguished by different emphases in their writing: Appelfeld by his memories of genocidal anti-Semitism in Europe; Grossman by his empathy with the Palestinians in journalistic accounts such as “The Yellow Wind”; Yehoshua by his connection to the non-European Jews, the Sephardim of North Africa and the Arab countries; and Oz by his liberal Zionism. Of the four, Oz is the best-known abroad, not only as a teller of tales but as a political artist. There is something about him—the lofty eloquence, the liberal opinions, the kibbutz-poster-boy good looks—that continues to draw crowds to his readings. Oz does not mind the attention, but he invariably finds himself out of step with his audiences. (When he is asked about Israel’s new Security Wall, Oz has stunned more than a few on the left by saying, “The Wall, unfortunately, is a necessary thing. The only problem is that it’s in the wrong place. It should run roughly along the 1967 borders.”) In Europe especially, he is well to the left of the synagogue groups and to the right of more secular audiences. Over lunch one day, Oz described how in Europe he often gets the question “How long have you spent in Israeli prisons?”—the idea being that, somehow, the Israeli government does not permit contrary opinion. Among some younger writers and historians in Israel, too, Oz is rebuked because he continues to criticize both the Israeli and the Palestinian leaderships rather than seeing the situation as a version of the French disaster in Algeria.\n\n\n\n\n\n“They’re angry at me because I refuse the colonial analogy,” Oz said. “Zionism may be a monster, but it is not a colonial monster. There was a strong element of self-righteousness and short-sightedness in the early Zionists, and they overlooked the presence of the Arab population and its significance. They had the self-righteousness of victims preoccupied with their own victimization to the degree that they could not even imagine that they could commit any kind of injustice to another. But then there is the problem of the left: in its struggle for the rights of the Palestinians, it overlooks the rights of the Jewish people.”\n\n\n\nI asked Oz why he had an especially hard time conveying his view in Europe.\n\n\n\n“Many Americans and Europeans are sentimental about conflict resolution,” he said. “They think the first thing to do is solve the hatreds, make friends out of enemies, and only then make peace. But, historically, deadly enemies, swearing inwardly to cheat and betray, sign peace treaties. This would be a divorce that results not in a honeymoon but in an emotional de-escalation that will take generations. Look at the Europeans. It took them a thousand years to make peace. Even as they wag their finger at us like a Victorian governess, they have a history of rivers of blood. I will risk a prophecy: It will not take the Middle East as long to make peace as it did Europe. And we’ll shed less blood.”\n\n\n\nIn the political imaginations of Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs, “Europe” continues to play an overwhelming role. “The Jews and the Arabs had the same oppressors,” Oz said. “The Europeans were guilty of anti-Semitism and the Holocaust, and the Europeans were guilty of colonialism in the Middle East and of the exploitation of the Arabs. In Brecht’s poems, the oppressed join hands and march together. But the two children of the same oppressive parent can often be the worst of enemies. The Palestinians look at me, the Israeli, as an extension of white, sophisticated, colonizing Europe, which returned to the Middle East to do the same old thing: dominate, humiliate, like European crusaders. The other side, the Israelis, see the Palestinians not as fellow-victims but as pogrom-makers, Cossacks, Nazis, oppressors in kaffiyehs and mustaches playing the same ancient game of cutting Jewish throats for the fun of it. You will hear this in many synagogues: They are pharaohs, the goyim, and we are lambs surrounded by seventy wolves. Neither party will ever give up this sense of victimhood and will forever dispute who was David and who was Goliath.”\n\n\n\nOz is on the Israeli left, but he is not to be mistaken for a supporter of a bi-national state. In his novels, the Arab is the Other: the figure of fantasy, of authenticity, and, nearly always, seen from a distance. Oz grew up surrounded by but not among Palestinians, and he has not travelled much to Arab countries. An episode in “A Tale of Love and Darkness” that rings false is one in which young Amos and his family visit the home of a wealthy Arab family and Amos inadvertently causes a young Arab boy to suffer a severe accident.\n\n\n\nAlthough in Israel most criticism of Oz comes from the right, he has been attacked from the left more and more in recent years as a younger generation enacts a kind of Oedipal battle against the founding generations. There is an Israeli version of “liberal parents, radical children” going on when scholars like Ilan Pappe, or the poet Yitzhak Laor, rebuke their elders for holding fast to the versions and iconographies of even liberal Zionism.\n\n\n\n“They would ask, How can he be disengaged at such a time?” Oz said. “Why isn’t he writing anti-Zionist pamphlets at this moment of colonial oppression? Then they criticize the subject matter— Jerusalem of the fifties, the kibbutz—as irrelevant, like a Wild West story for the younger generation.”\n\n\n\nOz has no sympathy for Arafat—“He imagines himself as a combination of Che Guevara and Saladin”—but he does for the broader Palestinian claim. “The Arabs were deeply injured by the creation of Israel, by its relative prosperity, by what they regard as an endorsement of Israel by most of the West,” he said. “The Palestinians were injured by the fact that they lost a significant part of their homeland. But this is not war of civilizations. Just the term—‘The Clash of Civilizations’—is a hopelessly Hollywood thing, kind of like ‘Star Wars.’ This is a conflict about hundreds of thousands of people who lost their homes, Palestinians and Jews from Europe and the Arab countries. There was one-hundred-per-cent ethnic cleansing of the Jews in the West Bank and Gaza in 1948. It is about one very small country inflicting a terrible, humiliating defeat on a people who have not had a military victory since the days of Saladin.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nOne afternoon, I met Oz in downtown West Jerusalem at a restaurant called Cavalier. It wasn’t an ordinary lunch. The other guests were Israel Kantor, a lawyer and an old friend of Oz’s, and Mo’en Khoury, a Palestinian Christian and a lawyer, who lives in Nazareth and has business in the Occupied Territories, Jerusalem, and elsewhere in the Middle East. A few months before, in March, Khoury’s nephew George Khoury, a twenty-year-old student at Hebrew University, was jogging in the French Hill area of Jerusalem at around seven-thirty in the evening when he was shot in the head, the neck, and the stomach by a group of men passing by in a car. He was pronounced dead at the Hadassah University Medical Center. Initially, the news of the shooting was announced in the Palestinian press as a victory, and the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, which is linked to Arafat’s Fatah organization, claimed responsibility for the killing. But when it became known that Khoury was Palestinian, and that his father, Elias, was a prominent lawyer who had contested land cases against Israeli settlements, Arafat’s office called the Khoury home twice to apologize, and the Brigades declared George a _shaheed_—a martyr—and said the killing was a case of “mistaken identity.” The Khoury family disdained the overture.\n\n\n\n\n\n“This is a barbaric act that will not change my world view, which includes deep faith in Palestinian rights,” Elias Khoury said. He called on the Palestinian movement to stop encouraging terror and on religious leaders to denounce terror “in a loud and clear voice.” He told Israeli radio, “Terrorism is blind. It does not discriminate between Jews and Arabs, or between the good and the bad.”\n\n\n\nPolice caught three suspects who said they had been cruising the French Hill area looking for a Jew to shoot, and when they spotted a young jogger one assailant got out of the car and opened fire. One of the suspects had only recently been released from jail.\n\n\n\n“I’m glad we could meet today,” Mo’en Khoury was saying now. “Elias is going abroad today.”\n\n\n\nFor a while, Khoury, Kantor, and Oz talked about George, and how he was planning to study law and go into the family business. Khoury recalled how his brother had led a fight against settlers in the nineteen-seventies in Sebastia and Elon Moreh. His father, Daoud, and twelve other people were killed in 1975 when a refrigerator packed with explosives detonated on Zion Square, close to where we were eating. Fatah claimed responsibility.\n\n\n\nThe violence of the past three years, Mo’en said, has been a catastrophe “all around.” In Nazareth, a popular place especially among Christian tourists, “one hotel after another has closed,” and one, which opened in 2000, has been converted into a prison. “The Pope’s visit in March, 2000, was supposed to be the beginning of a new era,” he said. “It turned out to coincide with disaster”—the start of the second intifada.\n\n\n\nThey talked about the settlements for a while, agreeing that they had been ruinous for both the Palestinians and the Israelis. “The original sin of the Israeli Jews is that they thought too much about land and not enough about people,” Kantor said.\n\n\n\nThe extended Khoury family, which is as close as it is prosperous, was interested in making public gestures that would demonstrate their feelings about the killing of George beyond their private grief. Kantor, who knew both Elias and Mo’en well, suggested that they read “A Tale of Love and Darkness” and consider the relatively rare and even expensive venture of underwriting a translation into Arabic. Oz has published twenty-five books, and they have appeared in dozens of languages; only two, “My Michael” and “Soumchi,” a novel for children, have been published in Arabic. Neither Oz nor Khoury thought that Arab readers would somehow be converted by “A Tale of Love and Darkness.”\n\n\n\n“It’s just a matter of knowing the other,” Khoury said.\n\n\n\n“It’s a peek though the window,” Oz said in agreement. “A chance to see the private lives of other people.”\n\n\n\nFinally, over coffee, Khoury agreed to underwrite the translation. The dedication of the Arabic edition would be an extended tribute to George, written by Amos Oz.\n\n\n\n“Please see if that is acceptable to your family,” Oz said.\n\n\n\n“I certainly will,” Khoury replied.\n\n\n\nWe left the restaurant. Khoury headed to his office in Nazareth, and Oz walked along the streets of Jerusalem, moving quickly, uneasy in the city of his birth, eager to get back to his home in the desert. ♦","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/11/08/the-spirit-level","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7b397f5b30646d05ed","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Germany","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"germany"},{"id":"5c2e1ccc41e4c73c088d77ee","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Holocaust","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"holocaust"},{"id":"5c2e1cb136cecf4019214233","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Israel","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"israel"},{"id":"5c2e1c7f397f5b30646d05f8","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Jews","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"jews"},{"id":"5c2e1c792bc86f2c9a244998","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Memoirs","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"memoirs"},{"id":"5c2e1c8b2710c62d1081542e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Middle East","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"middle-east"},{"id":"5c2e1cb12bfcc72cd92d0573","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Palestine","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"palestine"},{"id":"5c2e1d8ab75f002c8941e5a4","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Palestinians","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"palestinians"},{"id":"5c2e1eee2396212cbb9fcba0","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Second World War (World War II)","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"second-world-war-world-war-ii"},{"id":"5c2e1c7c36cecf40192141d5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Writers","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"writers"},{"id":"5c2e1ef441e4c73c088d79ab","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Zionism","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"zionism"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a18798b51cf59fc42477f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Profiles","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"profiles"}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a02f72179605b11ad9967","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"David Remnick has been editor of *The New Yorker* since 1998 and a staff writer since 1992.

It may seem to you, for example, that, paying homage to the devil of generalization, I intend the word “man” to mean some kind of composite, extraordinarily convenient *Homo sapiens*, a representative of humanity. You might think that for me a “thing” has some kind of definite meaning, which I intend to juggle with philosophical ease. Moreover, the very word “thing” may call up in your imagination something domestic, not very valuable, a thing of comfort or decoration. Incidentally, we might recall that Chekhovian doctor from, I think, “Three Sisters,” who, not knowing how to characterize a gift that was being proudly shown to him, twists it about in his hands and mumbles, “Hmm, yes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a thing.”^1^ In fact, he then, out of clumsiness, drops this thing, a mantel clock, I think, causing resounding repercussions. And still another intonation can be heard in the word “thing.” I once had an acquaintance, a jeweller, in whose mouth the highest praise for a bracelet or a rivière^2^ was precisely this word, “thing,” pronounced weightily, with a loud voice, over and over, in time with the weighing movement of the palm on which the precious object lay. Finally, the heading of my talk might produce yet another quid pro quo. For the words “man and things” perhaps suggest to another mind the image of a man in an alehouse, a lackey, a waiter,^3^ as a result of which, the word “things,” too, will hatch out of its fog and take on the image of things for which the management bears no responsibility.\n\nBy listing these possible misinterpretations, I hope to eliminate them. Of course, when I say “man,” I mean only myself. Just as the things I am going to talk about won’t pass without nametags into the fog of the commonplace. For by the word “thing” I mean not only a toothpick but also a steam engine. Everything made by human hands is a thing. That is the only general definition I will allow myself.\n\nA thing, a thing made by someone, does not exist in itself. A seagull flying over a cigarette case forgotten on a beach cannot distinguish it from a stone, from sand, from a scrap of seaweed, since in the absence of man a thing immediately returns to nature’s bosom. A rifle lying in the depths of a tropical jungle is no longer a thing but a lawful part of the forest; today already a red stream of ants pours over it; tomorrow it will grow moldy, perhaps even flower. A house is only a stone block when man leaves it. Should he leave it for five hundred years, the house, like a silent, cunning animal running for freedom, will return to nature imperceptibly, and indeed, look, it’s just a pile of stones. And note, by the way, how eagerly and how adroitly the very slightest thing strives to slip away from man, and how inclined it is to suicide. A dropped coin, with the haste of a desperate fugitive, traces a wide arc on the floor and disappears into the farthest corner under the farthest sofa. And not only is there no object without man, but there is no object without a definite relationship to it from the human side. This relationship is slippery. Take, for example, a framed painting, the portrait of a woman. One person looks at it and, with the cold admiration of a connoisseur, analyzes the colors, the chiaroscuro, the background. Another, a craftsman, filled with a certain complex sensation, in which images of his craft mix—the glue, the yardstick, the decorative molding, the firmness of the wood, the gilding—looks at the frame with a professional eye. A third, a friend of the woman depicted, discusses the likeness or, pierced for a moment by one of those faint recollections that are like the street urchins of memory, sees and hears with great clarity (albeit for a moment) that very woman put down her handbag and gloves on the table and say, “Tomorrow is the last sitting, thank God. The eyes have come out well.” And, finally, a fourth looks at the painting with the thought that today the dentist will cause him a great deal of pain, so that each time he sees this painting, he will recall the buzzing of the drill and how the dentist’s breath smelled. \n\nWhat does all this come to, then? There is not one thing, albeit mathematically there is only one thing, but four, five, six, a million things, depending on how many people look at it. What do I care about a pair of boots left by my neighbor outside his door? But, were my neighbor to die tonight, what human warmth, what pity, what live and tender beauty would these two old, shabby boots, with their eyelet flaps sticking out like little ears, left standing at the door, radiate over me. In my desk, in a crumpled envelope, I found five matches, their heads blackened. Why I had put them there to keep, what memory is linked to them, I have forgotten, forgotten entirely. I’ll still keep them for a time, for the sake of that memory, which I know is connected to them, loving them with some kind of secondary love, but then I’ll throw them out. Thus do we betray things. At a fair, in a remote little town, I won a cheap porcelain pig at target shooting. I abandoned it on the shelf at the hotel when I left town. And in doing so I condemned myself to remember it. I am hopelessly in love with this porcelain pig. I am overcome by an unbearable, slightly silly tenderness when I think of it, won, and unappreciated, and abandoned. With much the same feeling, I sometimes look at some trifling, inconspicuous ornamentation, at the flowers on the wallpaper in a dark corner of a corridor, which, perhaps, no one but me will notice. In someone else’s house, on the writing desk, I saw the exact same ashtray I have on my desk, and yet this one is mine, the other someone else’s. I remember, when I was about ten years old, my uncle died from diphtheria. His rooms were being disinfected. Perhaps they didn’t quite explain disinfection well enough to me: I understood that this man had died and now what they were doing was making it so that his things weren’t his anymore, removing from them the dust, the smell, all that which made these things precisely his.\n\nI don’t like hearing when people talk of machines: oh, our mechanical age; oh, robots; oh, this and that. Machines, instruments, have served us all. In this sense a penknife is no different from some very complicated factory machine. The point is, there’s no complexity here. We take the number of parts as complexity, but the parts themselves are simple, and in the end they connect together simply. When a man looks at a steam engine, its mechanism seems to him unbelievably intricate, because in his notion of it he has disconnected the object from the mind that conceived it. The mind is intricate and complex, human ingenuity is astonishing, but the creation itself is of course simple. The charm of machines is precisely the fact that every intelligent, dextrous man can create a machine. No, we have not moved much further on than our ancestors. In the fifth century, a clever Chinese man invented the submarine. The Mongols in days of yore stunned their Western foes with poisonous gases. I read an advertisement, for instance, for some firm producing all kinds of automated devices for the vending of goods, the latest word in technology, so to speak. Yet automated devices were already being used in gray-haired antiquity. Egyptian priests used them to play on the superstitions of their people. Magical urns stood outside the Temples of Isis. They supplied the faithful with the goddess’s blessing in the form of a few drops of holy water. All that was needed to make this happen was to drop a five-drachma coin into a slot in the urn, just as a young lady would do at an underground station to get a box of almonds. It turns out that this is a sacred and immortal gesture. Those auto-functioning Egyptian urns brought the priests a good profit for several centuries in a row, and of course the secret behind their mechanism was guarded by strict laws, even by the threat of capital punishment. This is how it must have worked: a dropped coin fell along a wired tube onto the well-balanced shoulder of a lever; this would cause a valve in the bottom of the vessel filled with water to open up for a moment, and a little water would pour out through a discharge pipe, into a cup placed there by a gullible Egyptian, sweating with stupefaction. And several centuries later, on the streets and even on the main roads of ancient Rome, there were automats for vending wine, just like the gadgets we have. Thus, a Roman, leaving home, would always take a drinking goblet. If I were a good artist, I would paint the following picture: Horace, thrusting a coin into a slot machine.\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nMan is God’s likeness; a thing is man’s likeness. A man who makes a thing his God comes to resemble the thing. Thus, one comes full circle: thing, God, man, thing—and a full circle is pleasing to the mind. An automat is in many ways most similar to man. You push it, it responds. You grease its palm, and it brings you pleasure. You give it money, it gives you goods. But in all other kinds of things I feel a certain resemblance to man. Underpants drying in a brisk wind launch into an idiotic, but quite human, dance. An inkwell stares at me with one black eye, with a glint in its pupil. A clock whose hands are at ten to two brings to mind a face with Wilhelm’s whiskers.^4^ Between the rounded bell-glass of a lamp and the bald head of a philosopher filled with luminous thought, there is a soothing resemblance. We have christened the parts of things, weapons, machines, with words we use for different parts of our bodies, making these diminutives as if we were talking of our children. “Toothlet, eyelet, earlet, hairlet, noselet, footlet, back, handle, head.”^5^ It is as though I am surrounded by little monsters, and it seems to me that the little teeth of the clock are gnawing away at time, that the “ear” of the needle stuck into the curtain is eavesdropping on me, that the teapot spout,^6^ with a little droplet poised on its tip, is about to sneeze like a man with a cold. But with larger objects, in houses, trains, automobiles, factories, the human element sometimes becomes startlingly unpleasant. In villages in the Schwarzwald, there are sneering houses: the little window in the roof is elongated like a sly eye. Automobiles, too, can be extremely eyelike, the more so because we give them not three, not one, but two headlights. Little wonder that in our fairy tales and in our spiritualist séances things literally come to life.\n\nI think that, by deepening these analogies, and by going into what I admit is a certain anthropomorphic ardor, we can lend things our feelings. In the lazy positioning of a woolen shawl draped over the back of a chair, there’s something moping: oh, how the shawl longs for someone’s shoulders! In an open but still perfectly blank notebook, there’s something cheerful, joyous, and sincere. A pencil is, by its nature, softer, kinder than a pen. The pen speaks, the pencil whispers.\n\nFinally, there are children among things. These are, of course, toys. They imitate grown-up things, and the more accurate the imitation, the dearer they are to a human child. In childhood, I was troubled by the question: Where will my toys go when I grow up? I imagined a huge museum, where they gradually gathered the toys of children who were growing up. And often now, when I go into a museum of antiquities where there are Roman coins, weapons, clothes, chain mail, it seems to me that I have entered that very museum of my dreams.\n\nWe fear letting—not for anything do we want to let—our things return to the nature they came from. It is almost physically painful for me to part with old trousers. I keep letters I will never reread. A thing is a human likeness, and sensing this likeness, its death, its destruction, is unbearable for us. Ancient kings were laid in their coffins with their armor, their implements; they would have taken their palaces with them if they could. Flaubert wished to be buried with his inkwell. But the inkwell would be bored without a quill, the quill without paper, the paper without a desk, the desk without a room, the room without a house, the house without a town. And, no matter how hard man tries, he, too, decays, and his things decay, too. And better than lying like a mummy in a painted sarcophagus in a museum draft, it is far more pleasant, and somehow more honest, to decay in the ground to which, in their turn, toys, and linotypes, and toothpicks, and automobiles will return.\n\n\n\n----------\n\n 1.

As for writing about\nthem, even Henry James, who’s seldom accused of playing to the cheap\nseats, had a rule: “Tell a dream, lose a reader.” I can remember when I\naccepted that my own unconscious was not a fount of fascination—I’d\ndreamed, at length and in detail, of owning an iPhone that charged\nreally, really fast.\n\n \nHow unfair it is, then, that Vladimir Nabokov can show up, decades after\nhis death, with a store of dreams more lush and enthralling than many\nwaking lives. In 1964, living in opulence at Switzerland’s Montreux\nPalace Hotel, Nabokov began to keep a dream diary of a sort, dutifully\ninscribing his memories on index cards at his bedside in rubber-banded\nstacks. These cards, and Nabokov’s efforts to parse them, are the\nfoundation of “[Insomniac Dreams](https://www.amazon.com/Insomniac-Dreams-Experiments-Vladimir-Nabokov/dp/069116794X),” a recently published chronicle of the author’s oneiric experiments, edited by Gennady Barabtarlo, a professor\nat the University of Missouri.\n\nNabokov’s ambitions weren’t interpretive. He “held nothing but contempt\nfor Freud’s crude oneirology,” Barabtarlo explains, and in tracking his\ndreams he wasn’t turning his gaze inward. For him, the mystery was\noutside—far outside. Nabokov had been reading deeply into serialism, a\nphilosophy positing that time is reversible. The theory came from J. W.\nDunne, a British engineer and armchair philosopher who, in 1927,\npublished “[An Experiment with Time](https://www.amazon.com/Experiment-Time-Studies-Consciousness/dp/1571742344),” arguing, in part, that our dreams\nafforded us rare access to a higher order of time. Was it possible that\nwe were glimpsing snatches of the future in our dreams—that what we\nwrote off as déjà vu was actually a leap into the metaphysical ether?\nDunne himself claimed to have had no fewer than eight precognitive\ndreams, including one in which he foresaw a headline about a volcanic eruption.\n\nIf all of this sounds too batty for a man of faculties, consider that\nDunne’s “An Experiment with Time” had gained currency among a number of\nother writers, including James Joyce, T. S. Eliot, and Aldous Huxley.\nIts path to Nabokov is unclear, but, however it came to him, in its pages\nhe recognized a fellow-traveller. (The author had his mystical side,\nBarabtarlo notes, “and the notion of metaphysical interfusion with, even\nintervention into, one’s life was very close to him.”) Consider, too,\nthat, by 1964, when he began keeping his dream diary, Nabokov was barely\nsleeping at all. At sixty-five, he had an enlarged prostate that\nexacerbated his lifelong insomnia. He described episodes of\n“hopelessness and nervous urination,” his sleep punctured as often as\nnine times a night by “toilet interruptions.” In extremis, he turned to\npowerful sedatives and hypnotics, but even with these he struggled to\nmake it through the night. In the depths of sleeplessness, mired in a\nsomnolent fog, who among us wouldn’t feel a little oracular?\n\nTo detect precognition, Dunne laid out an exacting regimen for recording\none’s dreams. Nabokov decided to follow it scrupulously, and almost\ninstantly he found himself brimming with precognitive powers. On the\nsecond night, he dreamed of a clock set at half past ten; the next day,\nhe came across the very same time in Dunne’s book. That’s nice, but it’s\nnot volcanic-eruption nice. A few nights later, he saw a more\n“incontestable success” while dreaming about a museum: “I was\nabsent-mindedly eating exhibits on the table—bricks of crumbly stuff\nwhich I had apparently taken for some kind of dusty insipid pastry but\nwhich were actually samples of rare soils.” Afterward, watching French\ntelevision, he came across a program discussing soil samples in Senegal.\nEureka! He had eaten the dirt of a future time.\n\nAnd yet Nabokov didn’t seem to linger on his victory or its metaphysical\nramifications. Though he kept up his index-card routine for eighty\nnights, he drifted from Dunne’s method. Rather than flagging his dreams\nfor their precognitive potential, he began to find patterns among them,\nbreaking them into categories: nostalgic or erotic, shaped by current\nevents or professional anxieties. Apart from a dry spell he referred to\nas “dream constipation,” Nabokov was a prodigious dreamer, his mind a\nwellspring of trenchant, tender, and perturbing images that he recounts\nwith verve. An old Cambridge classmate “gloomily consumes a thick red\nsteak, holding it rather daintily, the nails of his long fingers\nglisten\\[ing\\] with cherry-red varnish.” A cryptic caller “wonders how I\nknew she was Russian. I answer dream-logically that only Russian women\nspeak so loud on the phone.” There are capers: in one, Nabokov and his\nson, Dmitri, “are trying to track down a repulsive plump little boy who\nhas killed another child—perhaps his sister.” And there are intimations\nof mortality: “A tremendous very black larch paradoxically posing as a\nChristmas tree completely stripped of its toys, tinsel, and lights,\nappeared in its abstract starkness as the emblem of permanent\ndissolution.”\n\nThere are also butterflies. Nabokov was a skillful lepidopterist, and\nhe’d taken up residence in Montreux in part because it sat at the foot\nof the Alps, where rare species fluttered. He had a recurring nightmare\nof “finding myself in the haunts of interesting butterflies without my\nbutterfly net and being reduced to capturing and messing up a rarity\nwith my fingers.” In an ominous instance, a butterfly “eyes me in\nconscious agony as I try to kill it by pinching its thick thorax—very\ntenacious of life. Finally slip it into a Morocco case—old, red,\nzippered.” On another night, Nabokov lashes into a stranger with the\n“light metal, vulcanized handle” of his butterfly net. The stranger\nlives.\n\nBarabtarlo claims that “a good Freudian” of his acquaintance found a\n“dearth of material suitable for standard psycho-interpretation” in\nthese dreams. And there is something enchantingly agnostic about them.\nFull of slippage and vague yearnings, they feel like the scaffolding\naround a vast emotional labyrinth, never more so than in moments of\nfleeting intimacy. “Find some fruit in vase on side board,” Nabokov\nwrites. “Take a banana after making sure there is one left for\n\\[Dmitri\\].” Seeing his mother off at a cable car, he frets, “I have not\nkissed her goodbye and this bothers me.” More disturbingly, with his\nwife, Véra, an episode of envy explodes into violence:\n\n> Dancing with Vé. Her open dress, oddly speckled and summery. A man\n> kisses her in passing. I clutch him by the head and bang his face with\n> such vicious force against the wall that he almost gets meat-hooked,\n> on some fixtures on the wall&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;Detaches himself with face all bloody\n> and stumbles away.\n\nIf Nabokov drew any conclusions from the experiment, he was careful to\nkeep them broad. In 1969, he published “[Ada](https://www.amazon.com/ADA-Ardor-Chronicle-Penguin-Classics/dp/0141181877/),” the novel that brought to\nbear much of his thinking on dreams and time. (Helpfully, Barabtarlo\nincludes extracts from it, and from Nabokov’s corpus, in “Insomniac\nDreams,” animating the connection between the writer and the dreamer.)\nAt one point, Van Veen, the novel’s nonagenarian narrator, declaims:\n“What are dreams? A random sequence of scenes, trivial or tragic, viatic\nor static, fantastic or familiar, featuring more or less plausible\nevents patched up with grotesque details, and recasting dead people in\nnew settings.” True enough, but this ignores the sorcery running through\nthem—the tendrils of magic that led Nabokov to believe in prophecies.\nVeen is closer to the mark when he speaks of dreams as “tricks of an\nagent of Chronos,” suggesting that “some law of logic should fix the\nnumber of coincidences, in a given domain, after which they cease to be\ncoincidences, and form, instead, the living organism of a new truth.”\n\nThe germ of that new truth is in “Insomniac Dreams,” which is, above\nall, a meditation on the ways our dreams unmoor us—from ourselves, from\none another, from the most basic sense of duration. Barabtarlo points\nout that time in fiction, like time in dreams, has qualities of\n“passing, jumping, bucking, crawling, elapsing, warping, forking,\nreversing that we experience but can never quite get accustomed to in\nthe course of life.” Nabokov had mastered those effects, perhaps because\nhe was willing to accept that the river of time was more like a salt\nlake, rapidly evaporating. Or maybe it wasn’t even that. “The solution\nof the supreme mystery,” he once dreamed, “is that the cosmos with all\nits galaxies is a blue drop in the hollow of my palm (thus deprived of\nall the terrors of infinity). Simple.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1d77e56e652c90274791","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Vladimir Nabokov","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"vladimir-nabokov"},{"id":"5c2e1c777e716b454591ad9f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Russia","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"russia"},{"id":"5c2e1c7622d4972cd5b83286","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books"},{"id":"5c2e1c76ee7fe02cbd163324","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Novels","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"novels"},{"id":"5c2e1eccb75f002c8941e688","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Pnin","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"pnin"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907eefc98449f3364193d6d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Page-Turner","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"page-turner"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a8a8da97f12ef9160ae1","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/dan-piepenbring","email":"","name":"Dan Piepenbring","socialMedia":[],"title":"Dan Piepenbring is a writer in Brooklyn.

Throughout a long and protean literary career, his passion for insects remained unwavering. He published his first verses as a teen-ager, shortly before the Russian Revolution; in 1918, he fled St. Petersburg for Crimea, where he surveyed nine species of Crimean moths and seventy-seven species of Crimean butterflies. Two years later, as a first-year student at Cambridge University, he described his observations in a scholarly paper for _The Entomologist_. In 1940, having written nine novels in Russian and one in English, Nabokov immigrated to New York, where he became an affiliate in entomology at the American Museum of Natural History. The following year, he began working at Harvard’s Museum of Comparative Zoology, devoting as much as fourteen hours a day to drawing the wings and genitalia of butterflies. “[Fine Lines](http://yalebooks.com/book/9780300194555/fine-lines),” a new book out this week from Yale University Press, reproduces a hundred and fifty-four of his illustrations, some for the first time.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a Nabokov fan, paging through “Fine Lines,” which includes a critical introduction and several essayistic evaluations of Nabokov’s scientific oeuvre, can feel a bit like reading the second half of “Pale Fire”: one is confronted by a content-rich, almost dementedly tangential commentary on an increasingly inscrutable work. And yet, as with “Pale Fire,” the commentary is so fully intertwined with the work that, by the end, it’s impossible to imagine one without the other. The writer and the lepidopterist really do turn out to be the same person, engaged in a single, if multifaceted, project of knowledge and description. As Stephen H. Blackwell and Kurt Johnson, the editors of the volume, note, the famous four-by-six-inch notecards on which Nabokov wrote his novels were originally the medium he used for his entomological studies.\n\n\n\nWhen Nabokov started studying butterflies, his dream was to identify a new species. As a child, in 1909, he proposed a Latin name for a subspecies of poplar admiral that he had spotted near his family’s estate, only to be [told by a famous entomologist ](https://books.google.com/books?id=kJcP1P7vfhEC&lpg=PP1&dq=Nabokov%27s Butterflies%3A Unpublished and Uncollected Writings&pg=PA93)that the subspecies had already been identified, in Bucovina, in 1897. As an adult, Nabokov had more luck. He named multiple species, most famously the Karner blue (_Lycaeides melissa samuelis_), which he came across in upstate New York, in 1944. (Although his classification was later called into question, he was vindicated by [DNA analysis](http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2010/12/21/rsbl.2010.1077.abstract) in 2010.) Initially, Nabokov considered a butterfly’s locus of individuality to be in its wing patterns, which he reproduced in his drawings at a near-microscopic level of detail. Eventually, though, his attention shifted to genitalia, which evolve more slowly, and in a more linear way, than wing patterns. He produced hundreds, perhaps thousands, of illustrations of these intricate, baffling structures. As Blackwell and Johnson write, “In the genitalia of butterflies, Nabokov discovered an inner space and forms of strange symmetry and asymmetry: beautiful hooks and hoods, forearms, pugilists, and clasps and combs, spurs and brushes and elbows, even hints of Klansmen and tiny caterpillars or elephants!”\n\n\n\nOver time, Nabokov’s fixation on morphology and taxonomy—form and classification—shifted to, or perhaps turned out to have been all along, a fixation on history. He began, in the editors’ words, “imagining spatial variety as if it were temporal development,” assembling narratives, mapping the course of change over species and over geography. In 1945, the study of butterfly genitalia led Nabokov to his most daring scientific hypothesis, on the relationship between Old World and New World blues. Nabokov believed that blues of the genus _Polyommatus_ had originated in Asia, moved through Siberia to the Bering Strait, and headed south to the New World, eventually reaching as far as Chile. Few professionals took his theory seriously at the time, but in 2011 DNA evidence [proved him right](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/01/science/01butterfly.html?_r=0).\n\n\n\nIt’s tempting to find in the migratory butterfly a figure for Nabokov himself: a shape-shifting artist who travelled from Old World to New, transforming, along the way, almost beyond recognition. “I have hunted butterflies in various climes and disguises,” Nabokov wrote in “Speak, Memory”—“as a pretty boy in knickerbockers and sailor cap; as a lanky cosmopolitan expatriate in flannel bags and beret; as a fat hatless old man in shorts.” How are these three characters related—the pretty boy, the lanky youth, and the fat old man? It’s the riddle of the sphinx, and for Nabokov butterflies were its great metaphor.","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/vladimir-nabokov-butterfly-illustrator","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1d3d41e4c73c088d7835","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Butterflies","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"butterflies"},{"id":"5c2e27b12710c62d1081580f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Entomology","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"entomology"},{"id":"5c2e1f53425c632c6cd707c4","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Lepidopterists","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"lepidopterists"},{"id":"5c2e1d774a08312cd3aa6d2e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Lolita","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"lolita"},{"id":"5c2e1c777e716b454591ad9f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Russia","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"russia"},{"id":"5c2e1d77e56e652c90274791","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Vladimir Nabokov","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"vladimir-nabokov"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f161ebe912338a3717da","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Annals of Technology","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"annals-of-technology"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590ca6bf6c4c222f03a82451","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Elif Batuman has been a staff writer at *The New Yorker* since 2010.

It is home, too, to a book fair, which also happens to be one of the biggest in the world, and where everything, likewise, is about buying and selling, though the trade is in books—albeit only the newest ones, which appear in their hundreds of thousands each year. On the occasion of the fair, it is worth thinking about one of literature’s most important characteristics: its slowness.\n\n \n\nI’m not thinking of how long it takes to read a book but of how long its effects can be felt, and of the strange phenomenon that even literature written in other times, on the basis of assumptions radically different to our own and, occasionally, hugely alien to us, can continue to speak to us—and, not only that, but can tell us something about who we are, something that we would not have seen otherwise, or would have seen differently.\n\n\nSome sixty years before the birth of Christ, Lucretius wrote his only known work, “[On the Nature of Things](https://www.amazon.com/Lucretius-Nature-Things-Classical-Library/dp/0674992008),” a didactic poem about how the world is made of atoms. The atomic reality that Lucretius describes is not an isolated phenomenon—it is not a separate realm of electrons and nuclei, electromagnetic fields, particles and waves. In Lucretius’ poem, the atomic dimension exists side by side with the world as we see it every day, with its grassy plains and rivers, its bridges and buildings, its cows and goats, its birds and its sky. Lucretius knew that the two domains are sides of the same coin, that the one does not exist without the other. There is little doubt in my mind that the world today would look different if the progress of science had been anchored in our human reality instead of losing sight of it, for in that recognition lies an obligation and an unceasing correction: we are no greater than the forest—we are no greater even than the tree. And we are made of the same constituents.\n\n\nLucretius’ poem was long forgotten. But when, eventually, it was rediscovered, in the early fifteenth century, it marked a significant prelude to the dawning Renaissance, and, not only may it still be read today—it continues to speak to us, telling us things we have forgotten, or things we perhaps never truly understood.\n\n\nLiterature works slowly not just in history but also in the individual reader. I remember the first time I read the Danish poet Inger Christensen and, in particular, her long poem “[alphabet](https://www.amazon.com/alphabet-New-Directions-Inger-Christensen/dp/081121477X/).” This was in the mid-nineties, some twenty-five years ago now. “alphabet” is a list of things occurring in the world; in Susanna Nied’s English translation, it begins like this:\n\n\n> apricot trees exist, apricot trees exist  \n> bracken exists; and blackberries, blackberries;  \n> bromine exists; and hydrogen, hydrogen\n\n> cicadas exist; chicory, chromium,  \n> citrus trees; cicadas exist;  \n> cicadas, cedars, cypresses, the cerebellum\n\n> doves exist, dreamers, and dolls;  \n> killers exist, and doves, and doves;  \n> haze, dioxin, and days; days  \n> exist, days and death; and poems  \n> exist; poems, days, death\n\nAt the time, twenty-five years ago, I found this poem beautiful—there came from it a very special kind of existential glow. But it did no more than flame up for me in the moment. Then, a few years ago, it resurfaced in my mind. I don’t know why. But I read it again, and it had taken on new meaning. Firstly, I sensed a grief in its evocation of objects, animals and plants, as if somehow a shadow were now hanging over them. It could have been the knowledge that at some point we are to die and leave them behind, but it could also have been the knowledge that they might die and leave us behind. There are many animal species we no longer can take for granted.\n\n\nSecondly, I was now aware of how the poem formally intertwines culture and nature. The entities listed in the poem do not occur randomly but are structured, in two ways—alphabetically, and according to the principles of the so-called Fibonacci sequence in mathematics, whereby each number is the sum of the two preceding ones: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on. This pattern occurs throughout the natural world, in the genealogy of bees, in the branching of trees and flowers, in petal numbers, pine cones, pineapples, and sunflowers. This underlying structure, to which nature itself is at once oblivious and obedient, belongs quite as much to mysticism as to mathematics. In the words that the poem isolates, calling forth their singular entities and phenomena, the world becomes at once familiar and alien to us, at once sensuous and abstract, comprehensible and incomprehensible at the same time.\n\n \n\nChristensen is clearly related to Lucretius. The word that Lucretius used for “atom” is the same word he used for “letter of the alphabet.” This was also true of the first of the Greeks to write of the atom: they, too, employed the term for “letter of the alphabet.” Lucretius repeatedly compares atoms with letters; just as the same few letters may be combined in endless ways to express everything between heaven and earth, the same few atoms may be combined to create heaven and earth and everything in between.\n\n \n\nScience and literature alike are readers of the world. And, sooner or later, both lead us to the unreadable, the boundary at which the unintelligible begins. In one of her essays, Inger Christensen writes that that boundary, between intelligible and unintelligible, exists within us; science, she writes, conducts the conversation between readability and unreadability using terms such as chaos theory, fractals, and superstrings only because to use the word “God” would seem overbearing.\n\n \n\nEverything exists side by side. Atoms, letters of the alphabet, literature, science, the world. And insight and destruction.\n\n \n\nThe world in whose midst we now stand, with its skyscrapers and cars, its airports and its banks, also emerged slowly, and, if we were to pinpoint its beginnings, the great upheavals that occurred in Europe around the time of the rediscovery of Lucretius’ book would be key. The Italian scholar and humanist Poggio Bracciolini unearthed “On the Nature of Things” in January, 1417\\. He most likely found the book, perhaps the only copy then in existence, in the German monastery of Fulda, no more than a hundred kilometres from Frankfurt. Some thirty years later, around 1450, Gutenberg developed the printing press. That, too, happened in this region, in Mainz, only forty kilometres from here. Also around this time, the legend of Faust, the learned vagabond who sold his soul to the Devil, took shape in Germany. The roots of the Frankfurt Book Fair go back to that same period—the first one took place in 1454.\n\n \n\nIt remains unclear quite how the legend of Faust emerged, but history does make mention of a real Johann Faust, who matches the description, and who is said to have been born twenty-six years after that first book fair, in 1480, at a place called Knittlingen, not a hundred and fifty kilometres from Frankfurt. He is described as “a learned charlatan purporting to be skilled in magic,” and he appears to have wandered the region with sojourns at its various universities. We know he was in Würzburg in 1506, a hundred and ten kilometres from Frankfurt, and in Kreuznach in 1507, a hundred and thirty kilometres from here. And we know, too, that in 1509 he was awarded a degree from the University of Heidelberg, only ninety kilometres from here. So we can by no means rule out that Faust, too, attended the book fair at Frankfurt.\n\n \n\nAnother historical candidate is a certain Johann Fust, who lived from 1400 until 1466\\. Fust was a goldsmith and a business partner of Gutenberg’s, in Mainz, forty kilometres from Frankfurt.\n\n \n\nBut what about the Devil? Where was he?\n\n \n\nIf nothing else, we know that he was once in Wartburg, two hundred kilometres from here. In the early fifteen-twenties, the Devil was seen there by a monk who, late one night, sat immersed in his work, translating the Bible into German. The monk called himself Junker Jörg, though his real name was Martin Luther, and he was so enraged at the Devil for interrupting him in his labors that he hurled an ink pot at him.\n\n \n\nHere then, in this strangely hybrid world of superstition and rational thought, magic and science, witch burnings and book printing, the reality we now inhabit was founded. The invention of the printing press made it possible to accumulate and disseminate knowledge on a scale hitherto unseen. Here began the slow separation of science from religion which so radically altered our view of the world and ourselves that today we can scarcely believe that anything was ever any different.\n\n \n\nSo what was the Devil doing there, in the foundation of what was to become the world as we know it?\n\n \n\nIt can be held, of course, that the Faust legend is a Protestant formation narrative: the tale emerged at the time of the Reformation, and Faust’s sin is not necessarily that he seeks knowledge but that he does so while removing himself from God. And, to Goethe, who also hailed from Frankfurt, Faust’s sin was secular: he sought knowledge without knowing love.\n\n \n\nBut it’s hard to ignore the thought that where man strives for knowledge, the Devil will never be far away. It was the Devil, in the shape of a serpent, who enticed Eve to eat the fruit from the tree of knowledge, leading to man being banished from Paradise, and it was the Devil whom Faust evoked in his efforts to penetrate the secrets of nature.\n\n \n\nWith all our technological advances, from the printing press to the airplane and the nuclear-power station, there seems to follow a shadow, unseen and yet perceptible, for the consequences of these advances manifest themselves before our eyes. Karl Benz, who, in 1885, built the first motorcar in a workshop in Mannheim, only eighty kilometres from Frankfurt, could hardly have realized that, in the future, his machine—which would join places and people together, opening cultures to each other and increasing the radius of human life so considerably—would claim the lives of one and a quarter million people each year, in car crashes. Nor could he have known that carbon-dioxide emissions from cars would be a cause of global warming, rising sea levels, burning forests, growing desert areas, and the extinction of animal species.\n\n \n\nThis phenomenon, whereby the well-intended action of the one spirals into uncontrollable evil when the one becomes the many, is referred to by French philosopher Michel Serres as “the original sin.” Diabolically, although each of us may wish only good, by our collective deeds we end up committing evil.\n\n \n\nThe Devil is associated with transgression; he is its very figure. And, since the endeavor to wrestle from nature its innermost secrets is a transgression, Faust must accordingly seek the Devil’s help.\n\n \n\nThe Devil exists to us because transgression puts us at peril. The insight is as old as culture itself. And Faust was as relevant in the fifteen-hundreds as he was in the eighteen-hundreds, when Goethe wrote about him, and in the nineteen-forties, when Thomas Mann wrote about him in his novel “[Doctor Faustus](https://www.amazon.com/Doctor-Faustus-German-Composer-Leverkuhn/dp/0375701168).” “Doctor Faustus” begins with a scene which, when I read it for the first time, at the age of nineteen, etched itself into my memory. Two young lads, with the oddly sounding names Serenus Zeitblom and Adrian Leverkühn, grow up together in the depths of Germany at the end of the nineteenth century, and, at the beginning of the novel, Adrian’s father performs for them some scientific demonstrations. These concern how dead, inanimate matter may behave as if it were alive. Adrian, who will later sell his soul to the Devil, is amused by his father’s reverence of the mysteries of nature and shakes with laughter, whereas Serenus is aghast.\n\n \n\nI don’t know why that scene etched itself into my memory at the time, when I was nineteen, but I do know why I keep coming back to it: there, in that room, the living and the dead, the authentic and the inauthentic, alchemy and science, the Devil and modernity, all came together. And none of the elements present in that room has become any less significant to us since Mann brought them together, in the nineteen-forties; rather, they have become consolidated, for, since then, the atom has been split, and we have isolated and analyzed DNA, and now ventured into genetic engineering. The scientific opportunities this presents are huge—plants may be improved, food production increased, organs may be grown, even new life created. Man, we could say, has at last become like God. But, in one ancient text, nearly three thousand years old, we can read about what happened to someone else who wanted to become like God:\n \n\n> For thou hast said in thine heart   \n> I will ascend into heaven,  \n> I will exalt my throne above the stars of God:  \n> I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the *sides of the*{: .hangingindent} north:  \n> I will ascend above the heights of the clouds;  \n> I will be like the most High.  \n> Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell,  \n> to the sides of the pit.\n\n \n\nOr, to use the words of perhaps the greatest German poet of them all, Friedrich Hölderlin, born a hundred and sixty kilometres from Frankfurt: “Nothing makes with greater certainty the earth into a hell, than man’s wanting to make it his heaven.” Yet the mutual proximity of insight and destruction tells us nothing of the sequence of these things, and the same Hölderlin wrote something else, which is equally true, in one of his unworldly and exquisite poems: “But where the danger is, also grows the saving power.”\n\n\n*Translated from the Norwegian by Martin

But it came out in Norwegian, in 2011, three years after [Karl Ove Knausgaard](https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/karl-ove-knausgaard) began writing the first volume, in 2008. The person who wrote those books both is and is not the man who, last month, came by my office to talk about them. He is now, for one thing, famous in an unusual way, having shared a remarkable number of intimate and embarrassing details with his readers. (“I have to hide from myself how much people know about me,” he said.) He is divorced from Linda Boström, to whom he is married in the novel. He lives in London and has quit smoking. He seems to be happier.\n\nTo some readers, these changes may feel almost like a betrayal—as though “Karl Ove,” the character, has walked off the page, gone rogue. But if the passage of time has made the man a little blurrier, it’s also brought the novel into greater focus. Over the course of an afternoon’s conversation and a subsequent e-mail exchange, it became clear to me that I had not quite understood Knausgaard’s book. What I’d taken for a self-portrait was more like a snapshot, and what had seemed like a monument was actually something stranger—what Knausgaard, in our conversation, called a “cave in time.” \n\n*This interview has been edited and condensed*.\n\n__Is it true that “My Struggle” was originally going to be twelve books?__ \n\nYes. In 2008, when I wrote Book 1 and Book 2, the head of the publishing house suggested twelve books—one each month. For practical reasons, that didn’t work out. But they said they could do six. All the books were to be published in a year, from 2009 to 2010. It would be more like an art project, almost, than a novel.\n\nI had to decide how to write four more books. I already had one about my father’s death and a second about the present, with the children. The obvious thing was to go back in time. Then I thought that Book 5 could bite Book 1 in the tail—a circle. And Book 6 could be outside of that circle, dealing with the consequences of all of it. In the end, I did write Books 3, 4, and 5 during that year.\n\n__How did you write so much, so fast?__\n\nI wonder about that, too! It’s strange that, with three small children and limited time, I wrote so many pages a day while, before, when I spent all the time I wanted on writing, and even lived on isolated islands and in remote lighthouses, I hardly wrote anything. But writing “My Struggle” was all about lowering thresholds—between what was in my head and what was on the page, but also what was in the novel and what was in my life.\n\nWhen I wrote my first novel—I was nineteen—I did it very quickly. If you write fast, you feel like you’re entering something not yet familiar—a world rather than thoughts about the world. The novel was crap, unbelievably silly and stupid, but at some point speed-writing became like reading, a place where I disappeared. When the novel was rejected, I lost belief both in myself and in speed. I started to polish the car instead of driving it—and, obviously, when you polish your car, you don’t get anywhere, no matter how nice the car looks.\n\n+++inset-right\n\n[#externallink: /externallinks/5be73d1ccb13863d2f029839]||||||\n\n+++\n\nI spent six years after my first novel and five years after my second without getting into a new book. That was what I was longing for, just to write at full speed. Book 1 was written slowly, in something like eight months. I spent oceans of time on the opening pages—the sentences were written and rewritten—but the rest of the sentences were written just once. Book 5 was written in eight weeks. When the books started to be published, I had incredibly tight deadlines, which was a great help. Then I couldn’t afford to think about quality, only quantity mattered.\n\n__So you were cruising—until Book 6.__\n\nI failed with Book 6. I had to bury that book, and I took a break and wrote a new version that was finished six months later.\n\n__What happened?__\n\nI knew so much about what people liked, I completely lost authenticity in the writing. I just mirrored and repeated things. It was awful—really awful. So I decided to just write about what was happening at that moment.\n\n__Book 6 is almost like a blog, with time stamps (“It’s the twelfth of June, 2011, the time is 6:17 *A.M.*{:.small}, in the room above me the children are asleep.&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;”), whereas the previous volumes often focus on specific days or weekends. How did you choose those moments?__\n\nIn the beginning, the method was different. We moved stuff around and took things out in order to make it into a novel. The first book opens with a reflection on death, and then it’s the father-son thing, and then the being-sixteen-years-old thing that has been in my notebook since I started wanting to be a writer. It said, you know, “A bag of bottles of beer in the snow.” I always wanted to write about that.\n\nBut from the second book on I never thought, I have to write about that moment. I would just start writing, and then I remember something, and then I write about that, and then I remember something else&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;and I like that, because then the moments will maybe not always be the important moments but could be the moments that are just beside the important ones. There’s a freedom in that.\n\n__In Book 6, on the other hand, you’re not journeying through the past. You’re describing things that have just happened__.\n\nThe events I’m writing about are much closer to now, so they are much more precise. If I were to go back to the hotel and write about this encounter with you, I could write fifty pages about it, but if I were to recall when we met—like, [two years ago?](https://www.wnyc.org/story/karl-ove-knausgaard-near-death-experiences-raising-kids-puberty-brain-surgery-and-turtles/)—it would be more vague. In that case, I would already have selected what was important. It’s two very different modes of writing.\n\n__In Book 6, you call “My Struggle” an “experiment” that has “failed.” What did you fail to do?__\n\nWell, you can never reach an authentic “I,” an authentic self. I think it’s impossible to free yourself from the social being you are. I remember seeing an interview with Ian McEwan where he used the word “selflessness,” and I really understood what he meant: that’s the dream for a writer. [That’s a precious place to be](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/knausgaards-selflessness)—and if you are there then you are authentic.\n\nBut it’s not often that the writing goes there. I think of this book as many different modes and many different levels, and some are very close to me and authentic, and some are distant, and they contradict each other, and there’s a multitude, and that’s a self. I think I came as close as I could.\n\n__Was that the experiment? Getting closer to the self?__\n\nI had felt for many, many years that the form of the novel, as I used it, created a distance from life. When I started to write about myself, that distance disappeared. If you write about your life, as it is to yourself, every mundane detail is somehow of interest—it doesn’t have to be motivated by plot or character. That was my only reason for writing about myself. It wasn’t because I found myself interesting, it wasn’t because I had experienced something I thought was important and worth sharing, it wasn’t because I couldn’t resist my narcissistic impulses. It was because it gave my writing a more direct access to the world around me. And then, at some point, I started to look at the main character—myself—as a kind of place where emotions, thoughts, and images passed through.\n\n__Does storytelling itself—one thing, then another, then another—exert some falsifying force?__\n\nYeah. I’m reading now a very interesting book I should have read many years ago: Frank Kermode’s “[The Sense of an Ending](https://www.amazon.com/Sense-Ending-Studies-Fiction-Epilogue/dp/0195136128/).” Have you read it?\n\n__Yes!__\n\nHe explores the idea of all the stories that are around us, and then you have the real world as something almost outside of that. So the notion of Tick-Tock, if you remember it.&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;\n\n__The idea is that, if you isolate any span of time—even the span between the tick and the tock of a clock—that duration acquires a narrative structure: a beginning, middle, and end__.\n\nI mean, “My Struggle” could have gone on and on. I have a colleague—Thure Erik Lund, he’s a really great novelist—and he said, “If you want to make this really original, you should just keep going, keep doing it for the rest of your life!”\n\nBut, no, what I like is that it’s very much about those years. That’s why I dated it, because if I had started two weeks later or two weeks before it would have been different. It’s more, like, This is a block of time. That was me.\n\n__Do you still feel like the same person?__\n\nNo. At an event in Edinburgh about Book 6, I started to read the essay part in the middle, and I couldn’t recognize the thinking. It’s like a cave in time that I made.\n\n__You write, in the new volume, about a book by Peter Handke called “[A Sorrow Beyond Dreams](https://www.amazon.com/Sorrow-Beyond-Dreams-Review-Classics/dp/1590170199),” from 1972. It’s about Handke’s mother’s suicide, but it describes her life entirely from the outside, unemotionally. You describe Handke’s writing as both beautiful and “merciless.” Is there some part of you that wishes your writing had been more merciless?__\n\nThat’s a good question. Handke’s book is about the death of his mother, who committed suicide. My book is about the death of my father, at the end of a destructive period that I think of as a slow suicide. But Handke never represents his mother in the text, while I describe my father, his movements; I re-create his speech. Which text is more truthful? Obviously, Handke’s. I think I could have been braver, gone further in that direction. The question is whether, like Handke, you can represent the world more truthfully when you don’t use the conventional tricks of the novel. When I was writing, I felt very strongly that I had made my father into something like a character in a novel, and that I had manipulated people so that they could feel what I felt, or what I wanted them to feel, in relation to him. I felt that I was cheating.\n\n__So you wish that you had been more objective?__\n\nI think “objective” maybe is the wrong word—and objectivity is impossible, anyway. What I admire in “A Sorrow Beyond Words” is that it’s uncorrupt. We have expectations about how a good novel should look, how a good sentence should look, what quality is, what a story is, what a life looks like.\n\nThat’s why not fulfilling expectations is so important in literature and art. It makes it possible for us to see ourselves, because we’re no longer inside the expected but somewhere else—and from there we can see the world as we think it is. Art is a form of negotiation between our ideas of the world and the world. I had many ideas about what death was, like we all do, but then I saw the dead body of my father, and it was something else completely. I tried to represent that insight, or feeling, or whatever it was, and I failed, I wasn’t even close, but I realized that there was a gap, and through trying to fill that gap the novel was written.\n\n__In writing about yourself, were you also negotiating a gap between what you thought you were like and what you are actually like?__\n\nIn other people, I can see how suppressed anger, or suppressed jealousy, or even suppressed hate—and also, of course, class and gender and geography—play an important role in what they do and express, without those people knowing it themselves. I can’t see that in my own opinions and views, but the mechanisms have to be the same.\n\nAn important part of my books is that they want to find out how a particular view of the world comes into being. For Heidegger, the mood or state of mind always came first, because that is what you think *through*—your mood is always there. No document states it, it’s in no archive, you can try to describe it, but the point is that we don’t think about it, it’s just there. In these books, by writing about so much that I don’t control, I hoped that all this would somehow become visible.\n\n__Heidegger thought that some states of mind could make it harder to see the world clearly, while others could open it up. Often in “My Struggle” you write about seeing the “divinity” in the world—in Book 6, you write, “All it takes is one step and the world is transformed.” Are there spiritual possibilities that we can grasp if we approach the material world in the right way?__\n\nYes. Otherwise it would be meaningless for me to write about my life. The last time I was in New York I bought a book: Kierkegaard’s “[The Lily of the Field and the Bird of the Air](https://www.amazon.com/Lily-Field-Bird-Air-Discourses/dp/0691170479).” It’s about, what do you call it—Jesus’s Mountain Sermon?\n\n__The Sermon on the Mount__.\n\nJesus says you should be like the birds, and then you can enter the kingdom of God. And Kierkegaard writes about how if a bird’s nest is destroyed, the next day he’s happily rebuilding it. The future just doesn’t exist if you’re a bird. And I read this with, you know, such an incredible desire. A friend of mine has wood pigeons who build a nest, lay eggs, have chicks, and there’s a hawk that comes and takes them. That’s happened four years in a row. But the pigeons still go to the same place because, for them, the future doesn’t exist. Maybe they’re in what Kierkegaard would say is the kingdom of God.\n\nAnd then you’ve got Heidegger’s view on the birds, which is that they have a poor existence—they don’t really know anything. Two positions about being in the world. I mean, your baby is in the world. [*Ed. note: He’s four months old.*] He’s not aware of himself or who he is. It’s probably wonderful to be him! But would you go back there and renounce everything you know now? We’re not in the world—we’re looking at the world, longing for it. Do we want in there? Is that where God is?\n\n__In Book 6, you describe how, at your father’s funeral, the priest drew a lesson from your father’s life: “One must fasten one’s gaze.” You write, “Everything is there, the houses, the trees, the cars, the people, the sky, the earth, and yet something is missing because their being there means nothing&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;We have not fastened our gaze, we have not connected ourselves with the world, and could just as well, taking things to their logical conclusion, depart from it.” You write that we all have an “obligation” to find meaning in the world—even though, “objectively,” it’s meaningless__.\n\nMy father, I think he always wanted to be in another place—always wanted to be another person, to have another life. He had no presence, and sometimes, it seemed, even no awareness of us. I think it must have been painful to be him, and drinking was a way of getting away, of getting out.\n\nAnd there’s also a pull in me—away from home and into art, for instance—that I fear. It’s much better now—I think I’ve managed to fasten my gaze somehow—but [I’ve struggled with that throughout my life](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/what-is-the-struggle-in-my-struggle). Because nothing is as defined in life as it is in literature or in art. If everyone fastened his gaze on life, there would be no art.\n\n__Do you consider yourself a religious person?__\n\nI don’t. But, I brought up Kierkegaard’s discussion of the birds because I think the same: being present, being present in a moment, that’s the beginning of the kingdom of God. In that sense, I’m religious. You know, recently, someone else asked me if I believed in God. It was a very young person. And I said yes.\n\n__There’s a connection, in Book 6, between the desire to get beyond the rules and patterns of social life—to get “outside,” to the sublime—and Nazism. Did you always plan to end the novel with a long essay on Hitler? Is that why you called the book “My Struggle”?__\n\nNo, no, it was nothing to do with that. I thought it was suitable because that’s what the book was: my struggle. [It was also a provocation—the perfect title](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/why-name-your-book-after-hitlers). I didn’t actually plan to write about Hitler at all. But then it came to feel like an obligation. Using that title for your own purposes, it left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I thought that I had to go there.\n\n__You did find a Nazi pin in your father’s belongings after he died—a souvenir of some kind. Maybe it was in the back of your mind__.\n\nYeah, that’s true.\n\n__Was your approach to writing the essay different from your approach to writing the rest?__\n\nNo. I started reading, and then I started to write about it. The thought was that now you know this man; you know all his flaws and shortcomings and interests, and now you see he’s reading about Hitler—what will happen? This is a novel written from inside of one person. But also the things we’ve been talking about, about cheating—those things become acute when you write about the Holocaust. That’s where you really have to think about what it is to make something “appealing.” Because when you write about even the most horrible thing, there can be something appealing about it—an attraction, an artifice. That’s why “[Shoah](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/postscript/claude-lanzmann-changed-the-history-of-filmmaking-with-shoah)” is such an absolutely amazing film.\n\n__Because it’s completely concrete__.\n\nBecause it doesn’t pretend to give a picture of the past, because that’s impossible—it’s just the present. Just the people you meet. It’s just what is, now.\n\n__In the history of the novel, there’s long been a connection between a kind of concreteness, or aesthetic reticence, and an idea of “manliness.” In Hemingway, for example, there’s a distrust of language, and that distrust is linked to a desire to break out of the social world, which is seen as feminine, and into something more “pure.” Did you see masculinity—which is a major theme in “My Struggle”—as connected, somehow, to these kinds of questions?__\n\nNo, no. Anyway, it’s hard to say, because being a man is such a big part of my identity that it’s invisible—it’s obvious if you read the book, but to me it’s just how the world looks. I’m interested in masculinity, but I’ve never thought about whether masculinity has anything to do with the desire to get out of the world and out of one’s social circumstances.\n\n+++inset-right\n\n[#externallink: /externallinks/5be74270a5e8290b75dfd193]||||||\n\n+++\n\nI do feel that there is an incredibly feminine side to the book—but, then, if I start to talk about it I’ll end up defining what’s “feminine” and “masculine,” and people will get angry. It’s almost impossible to discuss these things outside of a novel—although, in novelistic terms, it’s a great subject. It has to do with identity, and with what it is to be “something.” And, for me, masculine identity was something that I was standing outside of when I grew up. I was bullied because of the ways I was “wrong”: I liked flowers and I liked to read, and I liked clothes and to dress up, which was completely wrong where I grew up. And then there was the feeling that I had no will of my own, that I didn’t stand up for anything. That had nothing to do with being feminine—just with not being a man. And all the emotions I had, the crying: it was everything a man shouldn’t do.\n\n__There’s a moment in Book 3 where your brother tells you not to worry—he says, “Think about David Bowie. He’s androgynous. It’s a good thing in rock, you see. David Sylvian as well. Ambiguous sexual identity. A bit woman, a bit man.__”\n\nYeah, exactly.&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;But, still, it’s very much read like a man’s book, and men relate to it. And in Sweden there’s a provocative masculinity in it somehow. It’s very strange, because I think that it’s exactly this area that’s very complicated in the book, because there are so many different layers and contradictions.\n\n__But there is in “My Struggle” an idea of representing attitudes that are forbidden today—the way you represent the homophobia you felt when you were a teen-ager, for example. Right now there are a lot of disaffected men who feel that their attitudes are unspeakable. Were you thinking about the politics of your own thoughts?__\n\nFor every thought, you reflect: Is *this* what I am? Is *this* what I thought? But that doesn’t mean that there’s a political view connected with it. Like, in the book, when I’m walking in Sweden with a pram, and looking at a woman, and feeling all kinds of things—or when I’m at a children’s singing class and feeling undignified, intimidated, minimized—that was how it was, it felt like a shock! A year later, I was fine, my masculinity wasn’t caught up in that. But *then* I felt it very strongly. People say, “Oh, that’s his view.” But it’s more about the feeling of being a teen-ager and being a failure; of growing up, being in your twenties, and being a failure; of feeling so many pressures about how you are supposed to be. Being outside of things. And that is a [dangerous feeling](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/25/the-inexplicable).\n\n__You say that feeling outside of things is dangerous. But in “My Struggle” you often write about wanting to get outside of everything—outside of yourself, outside of life, which can feel narrow, constricting—as a kind of spiritual longing__.\n\nIt’s very much about ideas of art and the sublime. The sublime is the perspective outside of us, which I feel is more and more lost in our time, because we’re more interconnected and less outside, and there’s no God anymore. Nowadays things are less and less things in themselves—they are in a *position*, you know? And I think there is a longing in “My Struggle” to get to the things in themselves. It’s the same with the self. I think that’s why the self is so huge in the book—because there’s a feeling that somehow it’s disappearing.\n\n__Is there a connection between the spiritual aspects and the political aspects of this idea? Today a great many people feel as though they’re outside of their societies—on the fringes. And they also feel trapped in systems, maybe of oppression, maybe of bureaucracy, or economics, which they feel keep them from living authentic lives__.\n\nI grew up in one of the most homogeneous countries in Europe. My family was middle-class—my father was a teacher, my mother was a nurse—and in my lifetime the country has been deluged with money. Schools are free, hospitals are free, if you lose your job the government will support you. So, when I’m writing about the feeling of being “outside” society, it’s very far from the direction your question takes us, toward the name of Trump and the rise of populism, or toward what I can see in Sweden, for example, where the integration of immigrants has failed completely, so that you have a generation living on the margins of the society—meaning that they don’t identify with it, that the police are not their police, the politicians are not their politicians, the teachers are not their teachers, and so on. The rise of the populist right, and the rise of terrorism, is of course always connected to poverty and to hopelessness, and to the feeling of not belonging. It’s about economic inequality. That is what we should talk about, nothing else.\n\nBut I’m not a historian or a politician or a social scientist, and I have nothing insightful to say about this. There are a lot of brilliant analyses of our time—Timothy Snyder’s great book “[The Road to Unfreedom](https://www.amazon.com/Road-Unfreedom-Russia-Europe-America/dp/0525574468),” for instance—but they are by nature about the big picture, the general structures and the long-term tendencies. What a novel can do is the opposite—it can go into the particular, into the concrete, singular life. That’s the only thing that really exists. The Rust Belt, the joblessness, the poverty, the opioid epidemic—they only exist as seen or experienced by particular individuals.\n\n__And that’s what you’re interested in.__  \n\nA novel is the only place where it’s possible to explore that. That is what makes literature so important. I mean, the two best books I have read about contemporary America are [Rachel Kushner](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/30/rachel-kushners-immersive-fiction)’s “[The Mars Room](https://www.amazon.com/Mars-Room-Novel-Rachel-Kushner/dp/1476756554/)” and [Maggie Nelson](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/04/18/maggie-nelsons-many-selves)’s “[The Argonauts](https://www.amazon.com/Argonauts-Maggie-Nelson/dp/1555977359/).” If people two hundred years from now wanted to reconstruct today’s U.S.A., they would come a long way by reading those two books. Central in them both is the feeling of being on the outside of the society that they’re, at the same time, embedded in. As a reader, you identify with them, and with identification a certain form of insight comes, filtered through your emotions rather than through your thoughts.\n\nNow, this starts to get complicated because what populism and the far right offer is exactly that—an emotion-based belonging. A common history, a common culture, a common people. It is “we,” it is “us.” But that “we” is general—it doesn’t really exist, it’s a fiction. So the duty of literature is to fight fiction. It’s to find a way into the world as it is, to open a road we can glimpse for a second or two before a new fiction has covered it again.\n\n__You write about how, as a child, you played in a Nazi bunker near your house. At that age, the Second World War felt completely abstract—like a story you’d read about. And then you found your dad’s Nazi pin; you heard your grandfather make an anti-Semitic remark. It turns out that the Nazis inhabited *our* reality. And yet their way of viewing the world was completely wrong; it was a fiction__.\n\nThere are so many fictions about the world, and what happens in those fictions is important for our view of the world. Maybe that’s why Handke, in “A Sorrow Beyond Dreams,” didn’t want to evoke feelings through representation. It’s one thing to read about the myths of history, to feel their pull, and quite another to see those myths unfold in the real world, as Handke’s mother did, being Austrian during the war. I assume—but I don’t know, of course—that Handke’s way of writing that book, of withholding all manipulative power, was a reaction to growing up in the shadow of Nazism.\n\n__I keep returning to the moment when your discussion of Hitler ends. It’s gone on for hundreds of pages. Suddenly, we’re on the balcony outside your apartment. You hear a child laughing, and a man’s voice, and the laughter is so infectious that you look over the railing, but you can’t see them. And that’s how this long contemplation of the Holocaust ends. Why did you choose to end it that way?__\n\nThat was how it was when I was writing about all of this. I was on the balcony, writing, and I heard this child laughing and I couldn’t see anyone. And I was filled with the feeling of having dealt with all of this, and now I don't know—I have no idea. I didn’t plan anything. That was how it was.\n\n__That was part of real life, too__.\n\nYeah.\n\n__Now that we’re talking, I remember that, when I came to that moment, *I* was at home, reading, and I looked up and saw my wife and infant son. I didn’t think that juxtaposition was very remarkable. But in your novel it feels that way__.\n\nWhat did you feel, when you read it? Did you think that it didn’t belong there?\n\n__In the novel, it feels like a shocking juxtaposition: the Nazis and a child’s voice. But not in real life. In general, I found Book 6—the last part of which deals with your then-wife Linda’s nervous breakdown, which is brought on, in part, by the publication of Book 1—to be almost uncomfortably real. You write, “Linda isn’t a character. She is Linda. Geir Angell isn’t a character. He is Geir Angell.” And so on__.\n\nSomeone was talking to me about the book, and she said that when my father’s name first appears, it’s almost shocking. His presence is different when he has a name—it’s a connection to the real world. And literature always has a gap, a veil between it and the real world. It has to be like that, and it should be like that&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;and then I took real people and put them behind that veil, into this closed world. Seeing their names, it’s like a glimpse of their real existence.\n\n__Toward the end of the book, you write, “This novel has hurt everyone around me, it has hurt me, and in a few years, when they are old enough to read it, it will hurt my children.” And, on the last page, you write, “I will never forgive myself&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;In two hours Linda will be coming here, I will hug her and tell her I’ve finished, and I will never do anything like this to her and our children again.”__\n\nI felt very bad at that moment. It was a guilt-ridden ending.\n\n__That was seven years ago. You and Linda are now divorced; you’ve moved from Sweden to London, where you have a new partner. Do you still regret “My Struggle”?__\n\nI don’t regret it. I think it was hard to see then, and easier to see now—people were hurt, and it was terrible for them when it was happening, but, still, it wasn’t the end of the world. There’s the guilt for my children, which is constant, which has to do with how I gave our story away to everyone. But, on the other hand, there’s a lot of love for them in the book. And when I’m gone that story will also be there for them.\n\nI can’t, if I’m honest, think that it could be wrong to add a book to the world. How destructive can that be, really?\n\n__Are people still angry with you?__\n\nYeah, yeah. That will never go away.\n\n__Is Linda still angry with you?__\n\nLinda? No. She read it and accepted it.\n\n__Reading about Linda’s breakdown made me feel guilty for enjoying “My Struggle” so much__.\n\nReally? I never thought about that happening.\n\n__It made me think about the novel as a whole. It starts by reckoning with your dad, who felt trapped in his life, and who did what he needed to do to feel freedom, and it tallies up the costs of what he did to you and other people. And then it becomes about you, his son; you also feel trapped, and you do what you need to do to escape, and that also has costs, not just for you but for others__.\n\nI agree. I think it’s true. I never drew that parallel. But I think it’s right. That’s a very accurate way of saying it.\n\n__Looking back on the whole project, what surprised you the most?__\n\nOne thing is just how much is in a mind, you know? The past, memories, books. But what also surprised me was that what I thought was idiosyncratic—what I thought was for me and me only—connected with other people. That surprised me very much, and still does. I think we are much more alike than we normally think we are. I think that’s a fact. It must be a fact.\n\n__You’re back to writing fiction again. Has “My Struggle” affected how you experience that?__\n\nIt has. I feel much freer. The hard thing is to find the sense of obligation. Because you’re free—you don’t *have* to be true. And it still needs to be.\n\n__What about from the perspective of craft?__\n\nI have no idea what craft is—and I have no idea what writing is. That’s true! The more I write, the less I know about what it is that makes something good. I normally think, you know, This is complete shit. And I send it to my editor or someone else, and sometimes they say, “No, this is alive.” Maybe two or three months later I can see that it was good. But I don’t know why. Really, I’ve developed a method, which is being in the present, sitting here, drinking some coffee, thinking of a memory. That’s the only way I know how to write. I don’t know how to write a novel. But I know that, if I just try, something might happen.\n\n__Suppose you were to take Thure Erik Lund’s advice and just keep going. Just write “My Struggle,” Book 7. Reading it, would we encounter the same “Karl Ove”? Or a different you?__\n\nWhen I wrote “My Struggle,” I was very frustrated, I felt trapped in my life. Before, the only way of escaping I knew of was through literature. That had always been my way—escapism. But in “My Struggle,” I used literature to confront my life, instead of running away from it. It was obviously a midlife crisis, every sign is there. Now I’m in a completely different place. I live the life I want to live. I am the same, of course, but maybe I am looking in different directions. My father is no longer a haunting presence in my life, and my childhood seems very remote compared to when I was forty and everything seemed recent, in an almost acute way. Now I’m much more interested in what I see, more than how what I see makes me feel.\n\n__In Book 6, you write that when you started “My Struggle” you had “nothing to lose.” Looking back, do you feel that you made a decision to write it?__\n\nNo.\n\n__Do you feel like you made artistic choices during it?__\n\nNo, not really. I was just looking for a way to make it possible for me to write about my father.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1cbab75f002c8941e4d2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Karl Ove Knausgaard","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"karl-ove-knausgaard"},{"id":"5c2e1c7eee7fe02cbd163336","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Interview","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"interview"},{"id":"5c2e1c764a08312cd3aa6c35","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Literature","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"literature"},{"id":"5c2e1c76ee7fe02cbd163324","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Novels","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"novels"}],"sections":[{"id":"5baa4fc372a78f2d0fa60a69","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"The New Yorker Interview","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"the-new-yorker-interview"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5909e5e72179605b11ad9914","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Joshua Rothman, the ideas editor of newyorker.com, has been a writer and an editor at the magazine since 2012.","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/joshua-rothman","email":"","name":"Joshua Rothman","socialMedia":[{"network":"Twitter","handle":"joshuarothman"}],"title":"Joshua Rothman, the ideas editor of newyorker.com, has been a writer and an editor at the magazine since 2012."}]},"dek":"“The duty of literature is to fight fiction.

In Norway, an intense debate is taking place about _virkelighetslitteratur_, or “reality literature,” a putatively fictional strain of writing that draws on identifiable characters and events. Critics of reality television complained that it was overproduced; the argument against reality literature is that it is insufficiently artificial, exposing and misrepresenting people who never consented to be a part of it. The country’s most flagrant transgressor of the code of plausible disclaimability is Vigdis Hjorth, whose prickly, persuasive novel “[Will and Testament](https://www.amazon.com/Will-Testament-Vigdis-Hjorth/dp/178873310X)” came out in Norway in 2016, and has just been published in English, by Verso. Earlier this month, the translation, by Charlotte Barslund, was long-listed for the National Book Award for Translated Literature.\n\n“Will and Testament” was a sensation in Norway, a best-seller and the winner of the Norwegian Critics Prize. Already one of Norway’s preëminent authors, Hjorth, who has written more than twenty novels, became a media fixation, having marshalled her prodigious gifts to suggest—or to lead people to believe that she had suggested—that her father had raped her when she was five years old. Hjorth’s narrator’s name is Bergljot, not Vigdis, and although she matches up with the author in conspicuous ways, Hjorth has said that the novel is not autobiographical. Still, she has become the biggest Scandinavian literary story of the past twenty years, except for maybe [Karl Ove Knausgaard](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/karl-ove-knausgaard), with whose work hers has been compared, sometimes superficially. Like Knausgaard, Hjorth is writing against repression, against the taboo on telling things as they really are. But he urges us to look at dead bodies; she forces us to regard bleeding souls.\n\nBergljot’s trauma lives as a secret that she keeps from herself. She grows up, marries a “nice, decent man,” produces three children, and plugs away at a dissertation on modern German drama while trying to write a one-act play. Eventually, she leaves her husband; her parents aren’t thrilled, but they chip in to keep her afloat. When Bergljot’s father helps renovate her bathroom, she worries about him having a key to her new house, but she doesn’t dare ask Dad—that’s what she calls him—to give it back. The reader isn’t sure what’s stopping her, and Bergljot probably isn’t, either. She exists in a vague state, batting away doubt and fear like pop-up ads from her psyche. Then, one Sunday morning, her pain hits its target. She can’t move, talk, stand. She suffers several more attacks before discovering their source: “I went to the Mac and read my text, and there it was, in between all the other words, and I had a shock, I was floored, and at one fell swoop I turned into someone else, forever changed into another by this moment of truth.” It isn’t until much later in the book that Bergljot reveals what, exactly, those words are: “He touched me like a doctor, he touched me like a father.” She has effectively written a diary that she never meant to read.\n\nThe main action of “Will and Testament” takes place decades after this episode. Now a drama critic, Bergljot has broken with her parents, who have “entered into a conspiracy to save their reputation,” and with her two younger sisters, Astrid and Åsa, who believe that her memories of abuse have been cooked up in psychoanalysis. Within the clan, Bergljot has undergone a sort of downward mobility, becoming “an outcast who threatened the family honour.” An older brother, Bård, has also absented himself from the scene, citing paternal neglect. The siblings bring to mind a broken chain of paper dolls, one pair displayed on the refrigerator door and the other stuffed in the back of a drawer. “If you didn’t know your parents had two other children, you’d think it was a normal happy family,” Bergljot’s grown son remarks, after an evening at his grandparents’ house. (They are the kind of people who throw birthday parties for adults.) Monstrous men don’t create art as often as they do fractured families.\n\nThe filial conflict flares up again when Bergljot’s father announces his intention to split his estate equally among his four children, with the exception of two cherished vacation cabins, which will go to the favored sisters. Bård and Bergljot raise hell—knowing they are being bought off, they refuse to offer themselves on the cheap. Then Dad dies, leaving no clear heir to the most valuable asset of all: control of the family story.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nFor years, the family has functioned as a closed circuit. Bergljot would fire off an accusation, and it would bounce from relative to relative, then return to her in unchanged form. There was nowhere for it to go, no way to alter its energy. The book’s claustrophobic atmosphere is exacerbated by the use of letters, e-mails, and text messages—sometimes directly quoted, sometimes paraphrased, occasionally mediated beyond all sense. In sharing them, Bergljot is doing the same thing we’re doing when we send a friend a screenshot: trying to break open a drama by drawing a new person into it. “Will and Testament” is a gut-wrenching novel, but it is also a gossipy one, which begs to be read in an old-fashioned, judgmental manner. Right and wrong, good and bad, are applicable modes of assessment here. The reader, furnished with primary documents, has the opportunity to take a side. In fact, to be a moral person in the zero-sum world of this novel, she must.\n\nThroughout “Will and Testament,” the plot is interrupted by short, cerebral chapters in which Bergljot meditates on life in the abstract, as opposed to reality in its particulars. She quotes the philosopher Arne Johan Vetlesen’s work on truth-and-reconciliation processes and ruminates on the Balkan crisis—cases through which she is seeking truth, her own alongside the universal. Bergljot’s friends are studies in solidarity, too. They serve as a gallery of character witnesses, attesting to her ability to maintain long-term bonds of love.\n\nShe cleaves so quickly and so closely to one equally troubled acquaintance, Klara, that the reader’s disastrous-friend antennae bristle in anticipation. Klara, seemingly a classic pot-stirrer, insists that Bergljot stop seeing her family. Yet Klara turns out to be a canny, patient tactician for her friend’s best interests. After Bergljot’s father’s death, she counsels, “Now it’s three against two and that’s new, they weren’t prepared for that but they’re still the majority, and they have each other.” Whether Klara is in affirming mode or egging-on mode, her most important attribute is that she is steadfast in her allegiance to Bergljot, adding one more number to her side of the field.\n\nBergljot is settling scores with herself as much as with anybody else. She is striving, in the Kierkegaardian tradition, to create a majority of one. It’s a solitary quest of detours and traps, including the fear that, as both narrator and character, she has somehow got the story all wrong. An inveterate phone-talker, Bergljot tells her tale as one would in conversations with a friend, doubling back on earlier versions as though to retrieve some crucial detail that might prove her claim once and for all, vacillating among indignation and dark humor and self-doubt. These stops and starts illustrate the painful circularity of Bergljot’s problem: people don’t believe her because she’s a basket case, but she’s a basket case because people don’t believe her.\n\nBergljot’s story can get blurry. Sometimes it’s been twenty years since she cut off contact with her family; other times it’s fifteen, and she still interacts with them sporadically. She doesn’t try to pave over the holes in her testimony, instead allowing them to exist as natural features of a turbulent emotional landscape. Nor does she tamp down her reactions. There is a certain audacity in saying, “I heard the email notification from my iPhone on the seat next to me, an act of war, was my guess,” and asking people to take you seriously. Many readers, repelled by Bergljot’s grandiosity, won’t. But, in my eyes, Bergljot saves herself from melodrama by being honest about her tendency toward it.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/5d8c00e2c1463e00088066c4]||||||\n+++\n\nHjorth is fearless on the complicated bonds between survivors and abusers, who hold power over them in the form of answers. Bergljot says, astonishingly, that as a young mother “I still had a small amount of contact with my family for the sake of my children.” Years later, it doesn’t seem to occur to her that she doesn’t have to go to her father’s funeral. An abusive parent is the alpha, the omega, and the person who teaches you the alphabet.\n\nWhen Bergljot reënters the fray, she does so in a headlong way that hardly protects her vulnerabilities. At the outset of the inheritance dispute, she gets up the nerve to e-mail Astrid, an expert in human-rights law and thereby “a kind of officially good person,” about the cabins. Astrid responds with a litany of dispassionate facts. Bergljot says, “I felt that I was threatening her with an axe, she reacted as though I was waving a plastic knife in the air.” Hjorth seems to be suggesting that rectitude can be the enemy of justice, and that neutrality can be a form of self-dealing. Proudly objective parties can’t satisfyingly adjudicate the most violent disputes, because they have a bias against the emotional effects of conflict.\n\nThe book’s turning point occurs when Bergljot, desperate to jolt her relatives out of their complacency, decides to read aloud her accusations at a meeting with the entire family, in the presence of their accountant. After so much mediated confrontation, she has to work herself up to this act of exposure (“Just see it through, because it’s absolutely crucial, this is about your life,” she tells herself), but she barely makes it through a paragraph before the family revolts. “Now is not the time or the place,” Astrid chides, deleting Bergljot’s speech as though it were one of her late-night e-mails. Later, Bergljot launches into a self-examination:\n\n> After my bombshell twenty-three years ago, I chose to withdraw, to heal myself, to seek professional help. Should I have called Astrid with the physical details, pleaded my case with a skeptical sister who loved her parents and had every reason to, who had a great relationship with her parents, who wanted a happy family, should I have called her and shared my open wounds, exposed my nakedness, so painful, so shameful, so intimate, so difficult to talk about outside the psychoanalyst’s consulting room, tell her things I hadn’t told anyone other than my psychoanalyst, not even my friends, my boyfriends or my children because it hurt too much and was too physically intrusive, because I didn’t want my nearest and dearest to have such images of me in their heads?\n\nOne senses that these are not rhetorical questions. Bergljot is trying to calculate the acceptable ratio of disclosure to damage.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn 2017, Vigdis Hjorth’s younger sister, Helga Hjorth, published her first novel, “Free Will.” A lawyer in Oslo, Helga is ostensibly the _levende model_—“living model”—for Astrid, the maddeningly evenhanded sibling in “Will and Testament.” In Helga’s novel, a family is torn apart when the narrator’s histrionic writer sibling makes false allegations of incest in one of her books. In the press, Helga explained that she felt badly used by her sister’s novel, and that she had written her own as a rebuttal. If a family in denial is a closed circuit, this was the feedback loop reactivated.\n\nHelga Hjorth claimed that her sister had invaded her parents’ and her privacy, by reproducing verbatim intimate conversations, letters, and e-mails. (Vigdis has said that she got permission to use such documents.) A Norwegian newspaper, in gumshoe mode, ran an article showing that a funeral program mentioned in “Will and Testament” was nearly identical to the one commemorating the Hjorth father, down to the reproduction of a sentimental poem by his wife. The implication: we tell ourselves stories in order to live, we call them novels in order to not get sued. But the argument that the literary part of reality literature is a legal veneer doesn’t fully square. If the parts of “Will and Testament” that can be fact-checked essentially stand up, then the novel must offer freedoms other than fabulation. These could be as simple and necessary as the right of omission, or of not having to keep typing the names of the siblings who make you sad.\n\n“Free Will” also became an immediate best-seller in Norway. (It has not been translated into English.) The phenomenon of an author ultimately making money from a sibling’s interrogation of her possibly ill-gotten inheritance, the ledger forever out of whack, is absurd in a way that one imagines Vigdis Hjorth could appreciate. Still, she has upheld her sister’s right to have written the novel. The rules of reality literature seem akin to those of Twitter: if you’re going to @ somebody, don’t be surprised if she claps back.\n\nReading “Will and Testament” in Barslund’s excellent translation, without access to Helga Hjorth’s story, is the closest one can come to separating the _scandale_ from the _succès_. Bergljot is far from a reckless narrator. In fact, she is remarkably alive to the plight of her family members, locating the loneliness in them even as they have marooned her with her unbearable past. In a way, she respects her uncommunicative sister, Åsa, and her father’s discipline in freezing her out of his life. Intransigence is at least a form of acknowledgment. “Dad’s crime was greater, but purer, Dad’s self-inflicted punishment was harsher, his reticence, his depression more penitent than Mum’s fake blindness,” Bergljot says.\n\nHjorth seems to have formulated from her experiments with living models a model for living, in which exposure—of the self and of others—serves a larger purpose. In “[A House in Norway](https://www.amazon.com/House-Norway-Norvik-Press/dp/190940831X/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=A+House+in+Norway&qid=1569855237&s=books&sr=1-1)” (2014), her only other book to be translated into English, the narrator, a textile artist, strives to depict “those who had the courage to speak against power when they found it necessary, regardless of the cost, who protested though they were regarded as mad, everyone who didn’t just want a head start for themselves but progress for the many.” The narrator reserves her greatest admiration for those who are willing to be both the speaker and the subject, the heroine and the wretch—“those who turned the scrutinizing spotlight on themselves,” and let it burn. ♦\n\n","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c832710c62d1081541d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Novelists","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"novelists"},{"id":"5c2e1c7c36cecf40192141d5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Writers","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"writers"},{"id":"5c2fa8a35b0bef2942ea80c2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books"},{"id":"5c2e228d81ab3335f580f4db","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Norwegians","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"norwegians"},{"id":"5c2e1d2d2710c62d108154da","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Norway","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"norway"},{"id":"5c2e23c02396212cbb9fcda4","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Incest","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"incest"}],"sections":[{"id":"592e2a5036e1a35e5cba5262","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books"}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a0470c14b3c606c109f25","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Lauren Collins began contributing to *The New Yorker* in 2003 and became a staff writer in 2008.

Wells published a pamphlet titled “[The Reason Why the Colored American Is Not in the World’s Columbian Exposition](https://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/wells/exposition/exposition.html).” The expo, which lasted for six months, was held in Chicago and was meant to chart the trajectory of the Americas in the four hundred years since Columbus had arrived. Though a handful of African-Americans had individual exhibits at the fair, there was none specifically dedicated to the history or the accomplishments of African-Americans as a people. Wells secured contributions for the pamphlet from Frederick Douglass, the educator and journalist Irvine Garland Penn, and the lawyer and activist Ferdinand Lee Barnett. Together with Wells, they wrote about the ways in which black life could enrich the fair’s official version of American history, which, as Wells noted in the pamphlet’s introduction, had rendered invisible the contributions of black people to the American might that the fair was intended to celebrate. “The wealth created by their industry has afforded to the white people of this country the leisure essential to their great progress in education, art, science, industry and invention,” she wrote. Wells and Douglass distributed the pamphlet at the fair’s popular Haitian Pavilion, and, eventually, the expo’s organizers held a “Negro Day.” Wells declined to participate.\n\n+++inline-ad\nadvertisement\n+++\n\nSeven years later, another World’s Fair was held, in Paris. This time, the African-American lawyer Thomas Calloway worked with the expo’s American delegation, and he invited W.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B. Du Bois to oversee an exhibition on black life. Du Bois was teaching sociology at Atlanta University, which later became Clark Atlanta University; in four months, he and his curatorial team put together a multimedia presentation that testified to the eclecticism and resilience of their community. They conceived the exhibit as a sort of cabinet of curiosities, full of juxtapositions and visual echoes, in which you could wander and drift, zeroing in on whatever caught your eye: a small statue of Frederick Douglass; a bibliography of African-American writings, containing fourteen hundred titles; four bound volumes of more than three hundred and fifty patents secured by African-American inventors. All of these items orbited an argument about the capacity of African-Americans to withstand, and fight, injustice, with pride, dignity, and joy.\n\n+++feature-large\n+++group-2\n[#image: /photos/5dbc9f0d1b4a6700085a7d92]||||||\n[#image: /photos/5dbc9f086729e800080bf9a7]||||||\n+++\n+++\n\n\n“[Black Lives 1900: W.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B.

For the “Exhibition of American Negroes,” he wanted images that conveyed the everyday integrity of black life: a sewing class at Howard University, a corner in the home of African-American teachers, decorated with a flag, a bookshelf, and two rifles. There are photos of baseball teams, soldiers, farmers, shopkeepers, people working in laboratories.

They featured facts and figures about population growth and political participation, educational attainment and financial clout. A line depicting the urban and rural populations of Georgia in 1890 breaks into a sudden spiral, resembling an elegant snake. Simple bar graphs are presented askew. There’s a surprising amount of open space, as though viewers are being asked to fill in the history and context that hasn’t been spelled out for them. The color schemes—predominantly red, green, yellow, and blue, with the occasional pink or purple—convey a kind of playful optimism.\n\n\n+++feature-medium\n+++group-2\n[#image: /photos/5dbc9f091b4a6700085a7d90]||||||\n[#image: /photos/5dbc9f0af225940008a0e34e]||||||\n+++\n+++\n\n\nDu Bois described the materials that he had selected as “an honest straightforward exhibit of a small nation of people, picturing their life and development without apology or gloss, and above all made by themselves.” He added, “In a way, this marks an era in the history of the Negroes of America.” The exhibition won awards in Paris, and it then toured the United States, where Americans were beginning to regard the decades since the Civil War as a discrete epoch. \n\nDu Bois’s charts and graphics return to the public consciousness every few years, in part because there’s something so unexpected about them. Just last year, the W.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B. Du Bois Center at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and Princeton Architectural Press published “[W.E.B. Du Bois’ Data Portraits: Visualizing Black America](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1616897066).” As the design scholar Jason Forrest has argued, in [a series of essays](https://medium.com/nightingale/w-e-b-du-bois-staggering-data-visualizations-are-as-powerful-today-as-they-were-in-1900-64752c472ae4) on the data visualizations’ craft and design, one of the reasons for their enduring appeal is the contemporary viewer’s surprise that they look so modern. It’s easy to assume that Du Bois and his team aspired to make art; the graphics suggest the front page of *USA Today*, if it were reimagined by the Suprematist painter Kazimir Malevich. But the informational graphics that Du Bois and his team crafted followed early-twentieth-century approaches to visualizing data. The results display resourcefulness, creativity, and a commitment to communicating their truths clearly and directly.\n\n\n+++inline-ad\nadvertisement\n+++\n\nIn “Black Lives 1900,” Rothenstein seeks to emphasize the relevance of Du Bois’s work through juxtaposition: materials from the original exhibition are interspersed with excerpts from Du Bois’s own writings and more recent remarks from writers including [Maya Angelou](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/maya-angelou) and [Ta-Nehisi Coates](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/ta-nehisi-coates). These interstitial selections seem intended to conjure a continuum of black voices, or perhaps to argue that the insurmountable prejudices of Du Bois’s day linger in the present. The connections can feel heavy-handed; the book is best when it leaves room for the reader to reflect on what Du Bois and his spectators might have seen or thought in their own time. \n\nThirty-five years after the Paris Exposition, Du Bois published “[Black Reconstruction in America](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Reconstruction-America-Oxford-Bois-ebook/dp/B00IJC320G).” In it, he imagines what might have been had the ruling class not exploited the racial divisions between poor whites and former slaves after the Civil War. Sifting through the Paris materials, one can find the seeds for this later project. The missed opportunity of Reconstruction, Du Bois argues, was that these two dispossessed groups had failed to recognize their common plight. Something else was possible. For a spell, black life had flourished, and he had the evidence: a portrait of a young woman grinning to herself, and radiant charts that indicated a growing slice of the pie.\n\n\n+++feature-medium\n+++group-2\n[#image: /photos/5dc1f557f7d6d5000813ad6e]||||||\n[#image:

Du Bois, the twentieth century’s leading black intellectual, once lived at 3059 Villa Avenue, in the Bronx. He moved to a small rented house there with his wife, Nina Gomer Du Bois, and their daughter, Yolande, in about 1912\\. When I’m walking in that borough I sometimes stop by the site. It’s just off Jerome Avenue, not far from the Bedford Park subway station. The anchor business at that intersection seems to be the Osvaldo #5 Barber Shop, which flies pennants advertising services for sending money to Africa and to Bangladesh. All kinds of people pass by. You hear Spanish and Chinese and maybe Hausa spoken on the street. The first time I went to Du Bois’s old address, I wondered if I might find a plaque, but the house is gone, and 3059 Villa is now part of a fenced-in parking lot. Maple and locust trees shade the front stoops, and residents wait at eight-twenty on Tuesday mornings to move their cars for the street-sweeping truck. A fire hydrant drips, slowly enlarging a hole in the sidewalk. Even unmemorialized, 3059 Villa is a not-unpleasant spot from which to contemplate the great man’s life.\n\nAbout a forty-minute walk away is the Bronx Zoo. In 1912, it was called the New York Zoological Park, and it was run by a patrician named Madison Grant from an old New York family. Though he and Du Bois lived and worked within a few miles of each other for decades, I don’t know if the two ever met. As much as anyone on the planet, Grant was Du Bois’s natural enemy. Grant favored a certain type of white man over all other kinds of humans, on a graded scale of disapproval, and he reserved his vilest ill wishes and contempt for blacks.\n\nAs Du Bois would have remembered, in 1906 the zoo put an African man named Ota Benga on display in the primate cages. Ota Benga belonged to a tribe of Pygmies whom the Belgians had slaughtered in the Congo. A traveller had brought him to New York and to the zoo, where huge crowds came to stare and jeer. A group of black Baptist ministers went to the mayor and demanded that the travesty be stopped. The mayor’s office referred them to Grant, who put them off. He later said that it was important for the zoo not to give even the appearance of having yielded to the ministers’ demand. Eventually, Ota Benga was moved to the Howard Colored Orphan Asylum, in Brooklyn, and he ended up in Virginia, where he shot himself.\n\nMadison Grant was someone who preferred to stay in the background and pull strings; but because of history, both past and present, he is not in the background anymore. Like other men of his social set—[Teddy Roosevelt](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/theodore-roosevelt) and Henry Fairfield Osborn, a president of the [American Museum of Natural History](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/american-museum-of-natural-history), to name two—Grant adored nature, which to his milieu meant the North American continent, minus its original native population and reconstituted as a hunting preserve and contemplative retreat for themselves. Grant and others founded the conservation movement in America. They helped to save the buffalo. When the herds on the Great Plains had been almost destroyed, a new herd was started in Oklahoma, with animals shipped by rail from the zoo. Today, of the thousands of buffalo on the plains, many have distant relatives in the Bronx; the force behind the reintroduction was the American Bison Society, of which Grant was a principal member.\n\nThat was the “better” Grant. But, like a character in a comic book who harbors an inner arch-villain with a plan to destroy the universe, Grant had another side. Just as he feared that certain species of native wildlife would go extinct, he feared that the same would happen to a precious (and largely imaginary) kind of white person. To address this potential disaster, in 1916 he published what remains his best-known book, “The Passing of the Great Race; or, the Racial Basis of European History.” A centenary edition is available online.\n\nTo return for a moment to the “better” Grant: starting in 1906, he headed the commission that built the Bronx River Parkway. The commission bought up property along the river valley and created a landscaped autoroute leading to the headwaters in Westchester County. The project became a model for other parkways in the city and beyond.\n\nIn an oak grove overlooking the river is a flagpole with a plaque honoring “the founder of the Bronx River Parkway.” But the honoree is William White Niles, another commission member. There is no memorial devoted to Grant anywhere along the parkway; nor are there any public monuments to Grant at the zoo. In the borough where he did a lot for New York’s civic improvement, nothing is named for Madison Grant.\n\n“The Passing of the Great Race” is probably why. It became one of the most famous racist books ever written, and today it’s considered part of a modern genre that began with Arthur de Gobineau’s “The Inequality of Human Races,” published in 1853-55\\. Hitler read “The Passing of the Great Race” in translation, admired what Grant had to say about the great “Nordic race,” and wrote the author a fan letter, calling the book “my Bible.” Grant took pride in the Nazis’ use of his book and sent them copies of a subsequent one, about how American Nordics like himself had conquered North America. He also was a director of the American Eugenics Society, thought “worthless” individuals should be sterilized, and considered his lobbying for the Johnson-Reed Immigration Act of 1924, which shut down most immigration to the U.S., to be one of the great achievements of his life.\n\nThe preposterousness of “The Passing of the Great Race” approaches the sublime. To summarize: according to Grant, all of Western civilization was created by a race of tall, blond, warlike people who ventured down from Northern Europe every so often to help start great cultures, such as ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome, before retiring into their northern forests. Over time, a lot of these Nordics became “mongrelized” by mixing with “inferior races” (Grant’s books cannot be described without the use of many quotation marks), or else they killed one another off in internecine wars because of their bravery and their love of fighting, as they were doing at that very moment in the Great War. By Grant’s reckoning, the greatest men in Western history had been Nordics. Among the stars he claimed for the team, [Leonardo da Vinci](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/leonardo-da-vinci), [Michelangelo](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/michelangelo), and [Dante](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/dante) all clearly possessed Nordic blood, as he had determined by careful study of the shapes of their heads in busts.\n\nHe wrote that a major problem leading to Nordic “mongrelization” was the uncoöperative Nordic women, who had a habit of choosing the wrong men to mate with. Grant himself never married. He conceded, with regret, “It would be in a democracy, a virtual impossibility to limit by law the right to breed to a privileged and chosen few.”\n\nAnd what was the special attribute the Nordics possessed that made them so unique and sacred? Grant didn’t talk about it much, but it slipped out once in a while. The secret dwelt in a mysterious substance known as “germ-plasm.” Everybody had it, but the Nordics’ germ-plasm was the best. Grant and his co-believers could apparently use phrases such as “our superior germ-plasm” with a straight face.\n\nGrant often popped up in the news. He had a bald head, white sideburns, and a mustache that spread widely on either side of his face. The social pages followed his comings and goings, when he summered in Bar Harbor and wintered in Boca Raton. New York society either did not know what he had written (and said, and done) or did not care, or it agreed with him.\n\nHe died in 1937\\. Soon the war put his love of the Nazis in a new light, and years of almost no public mention followed. But, as dependable old hatreds are rising up again, Grant has become more current. An excellent and unsparing biography, “[Defending the Master Race: Conservation, Eugenics, and the Legacy of Madison Grant](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01708AJRI/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1),” by Jonathan Peter Spiro, came out in 2009\\. (Grant was the first person to use the term “master race” in a modern context.) And earlier this year Daniel Okrent published “[The Guarded Gate: Bigotry, Eugenics, and the Law That Kept Two Generations of Jews, Italians, and Other European Immigrants Out of America](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MKDJP4Z/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1),” which skillfully describes Grant’s and his pals’ nativist maneuverings. Okrent notes that Charles Scribner’s Sons published Grant’s major books and others by authors of similar leanings. At the same time that Scribner published Hemingway and Fitzgerald, it was the leading purveyor of white-supremacist books in America.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn March, 1929, the Chicago Forum Council, a cultural organization that included white and black members, announced the presentation of “One of the Greatest Debates Ever Held.” According to the Forum’s advertisement, the debate was to take place on Sunday, March 17th, at 3 *p.m.*{: .small}, in a large hall on South Wabash Avenue. The topic was “Shall the Negro Be Encouraged to Seek Cultural Equality?”\n\nIn smaller letters, the ad asked, “Has the Negro the Same Intellectual Possibilities As Other Races?” and below that the answer “Yes!” appeared with a photograph of Du Bois, who would be arguing the affirmative. Alongside the answer “No!” was a photograph of Lothrop Stoddard, a writer, who would argue the negative. In the picture, Stoddard projects a roguish, matinée-idol aura, with slicked-down hair and a black mustache. The ad identified him as a “versatile popularizer of certain theories on race problems” who had been “spreading alarm among white Nordics.”\n\nThe Forum Council did not oversell its claim. The Du Bois-Stoddard debate turned out to be a singular event, as important in its way as Lincoln-Douglas or Kennedy-Nixon. The reason more people don’t know about it may be its asymmetry. The other historic matchups featured rivals who disagreed politically but wouldn’t have disputed their opponent’s right to exist. Stoddard had written that “mulattoes” like Du Bois, who could not accept their inferior status, were the chief cause of racial unrest in the United States, and he looked forward to their dying out.\n\nDu Bois’s life has been chronicled definitively in David Levering Lewis’s biography, and Grant now has a biographer, but nobody has written a biography of Stoddard. One does exist of Stoddard’s father, John Lawson Stoddard, the world traveller who became one of the most successful public speakers of his day. Stoddard’s mother divorced his father for abandonment when Stoddard was a teen-ager. Later, Stoddard, Sr., in his villa in the Tyrol, enlisted an admirer to write the story of his life, and when the biography came out it did not mention that he had a son.\n\nThe Forum ad got it right—Stoddard was a “versatile popularizer.” As Huxley was to Darwin, so Stoddard was to Madison Grant. You can almost, but not really, feel sorry for the father-deprived young writer who found a hero in the wealthy older racist. Stoddard grew up in Brookline, Massachusetts, attended Harvard like Stoddards before him, and got a Ph.D. in history. In the course of thirty-six years, he wrote at least eighteen books and countless magazine and newspaper articles. He always had to hustle. Basically, he was a freelance writer. His first book, “The French Revolution in San Domingo,” came out in 1914, and he dedicated it to his mother. In it, he discovered what would become his most successful writing strategies: scaring the reader with the spectre of race war, and scaring the Nordic reader with the prospect of _losing_ a race war, as Stoddard interpreted what had happened to the Frenchmen in San Domingo (Haiti). There, as in later Stoddard imaginings, the villains were “mulattoes.” They became inflamed by the French Revolution, and then inflamed their fellow-blacks.\n\nFor Stoddard, the pivotal event of recent history was the Russo-Japanese War. By his reckoning, the defeat of a “white” country (Russia) by a “colored” country (Japan) in 1905 had opened the door to disaster. At some point after his Haiti book came out, he read “The Passing of the Great Race,” and it changed his life. Combining Grant’s view of the besieged and noble Nordics with his own ideas about nonwhite peoples, he predicted an imminent worldwide uprising against the “Nordic race.” “The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy” appeared in early 1920\\. Grant wrote the introduction.\n\nThe book was an instant hit. Reviewers noticed it favorably. [Franz Boas](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/03/08/the-measure-of-america), the anthropologist, panned it, but the _Times_ wrote an approving editorial:\n\n> Lothrop Stoddard evokes a new peril, that of an eventual submersion beneath vast waves of yellow men, brown men, black men and red men, whom the Nordics have hitherto dominated . . . with Bolshevism menacing us on the one hand and race extinction through warfare on the other, many people are not unlikely to give [Stoddard’s book] respectful consideration.\n\nIn a speech outdoors before more than a hundred thousand people, black and white, in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1921, President Warren G. Harding declared that blacks must have full economic and political rights, but that segregation was also essential to prevent “racial amalgamation,” and social equality was thus a dream that blacks must give up. Harding added:\n\n> Whoever will take the time to read and ponder Mr. Lothrop Stoddard’s book on “The Rising Tide of Color” . . . must realize that our race problem here in the United States is only a phase of a race issue that the whole world confronts.\n\nThe plug must have sold more than a few books for Stoddard.\n\nBlack people as well as white read “The Rising Tide of Color.” Black newspapers called him “the high priest of racial baloney” and “the unbearable Lothrop Stoddard.” A black columnist wrote that the news of the white race’s impending demise would probably come as a surprise to Negroes in the South. And Stoddard’s statistic, that the “colored races” outnumbered whites, did not alarm the black demographic. “The New Book by a White Author Shows Rising Tide of Color Against Oppression; Latest Statistics Show Twice As Many Colored People in the World As White,” an optimistic headline in the Baltimore _Afro-American_ said.\n\nStoddard, in the fog of his apocalyptic musings, made some predictions. He said that Japan was going to expand its influence in the Pacific and get into conflict with the United States, that the brown people of India would throw the British out, and that the Islamic world would grow militant and begin hostilities against the West. Whatever his philosophy and methods, his guesses sometimes proved out.\n\nStoddard was also more talkative than his mentor on the subject of the Nordic race’s secret sauce. In “The Revolt Against Civilization: The Menace of the Under Man,” a follow-up to “The Rising Tide of Color,” he explained:\n\n> The new individual consists, from the start, of two sorts of plasm. Almost the whole of him is _body_-plasm—the ever-multiplying cells which differentiate into the organs of the body. But he also contains _germ_-plasm. At his very conception a tiny bit of the life stuff from which he springs is set aside, is carefully isolated from the body-plasm, and follows a course of development entirely its own. In fact, the germ-plasm is not really part of the individual; he is merely its _bearer_, destined to pass it on to other bearers of the life chain.\n\nThis was the person whom Du Bois would debate, and try to prove that a black person could be the equal of.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAt the time of the debate, Du Bois had just turned sixty-one. He had already written “[The Souls of Black Folk](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0083ZJ86G/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1),” helped to found the N.A.A.C.P., organized and led Pan-African conferences, and gained tens of thousands of readers for _The Crisis_, the N.A.A.C.P.’s magazine, which he edited and frequently contributed to. Like Stoddard, he had a Ph.D. in history from Harvard. He wore a more modest mustache, stood barely five feet six, and smoked Benson & Hedges cigarettes. Despite being often on the road and under plenty of stress, he lived for thirty-four more years.\n\nStoddard admitted to reading Du Bois’s books, and once went so far as to say that he treasured them in his library. He seems to have taken a kind of negative inspiration from Du Bois. On the first page of “The Souls of Black Folk,” published in 1903, Du Bois wrote, “The problem of the Twentieth Century is the problem of the color line.” On page 1 of “The French Revolution in San Domingo,” Stoddard wrote, in 1914, “The ‘conflict of color’ . . . bids fair to be the fundamental problem of the twentieth century.” In “The Rising Tide of Color,” he cites Du Bois, to the effect that the colored peoples of the world are getting tired of white domination and will soon rise up.\n\nThe Chicago debate happened in this way: about a year and a half earlier, the magazine _The Forum_ had asked Stoddard and Alain LeRoy Locke, the black writer, philosopher, and founding figure of the Harlem Renaissance, to write on the subject “Shall We Give the Negro Cultural Equality?” The magazine also asked the two to read their pieces live on the radio. But then Locke, recovering from an unhappy affair with Langston Hughes, went to Europe, and by September 23, 1927, the day of the broadcast, he had not returned.\n\nDu Bois agreed to fill in. What he said on air, elaborating on what Locke had written, must have been good, because _The Forum’s_ editor told him that the debate was “a corker,” and the consensus was that Du Bois had won. The Forum Council organizers then suggested holding the debate again, before a paying crowd.\n\nStoddard had to have known that the audience would be mostly black. Home-field advantage would be with Du Bois. Why did Stoddard agree? Like any author with books to sell, he probably thought he could use the publicity. (He had two new ones, “The Story of Youth” and “Luck: Your Silent Partner.”) Also, Stoddard probably believed that he could overawe any audience of blacks. He had denied being a member of the Ku Klux Klan but endorsed its tactics passionately in his books. And, in 1926, he gave a lecture before two thousand at Tuskegee University, in Alabama, informing them that the Nordic race was superior to nonwhites and that, for the good of all races, the world must continue to be governed by white supremacy. A black newspaper reported that the students “sat awestricken during the address, which terminated without any applause.”\n\nDu Bois, a realist, wondered if Stoddard would show up. In letters to Fred Atkins Moore, the director of the Forum Council, Du Bois asked if they should line up an alternate. He suggested inviting an egregiously racist senator, like James Thomas Heflin, of Alabama: “He would be a scream and you would clean up if you could get hold of him.” But Stoddard made positive noises about his plans to be there. He and Du Bois agreed in advance on the topic. It was decided that Du Bois would speak first.\n\nTickets for the debate sold for fifty or seventy-five cents. The crowd numbered five thousand, four thousand, or three thousand, according to different counts. Du Bois, in a letter to his wife, Nina, said that hundreds could not get in. The Chicago _Defender_, the city’s leading black newspaper, ran a photo that showed a packed hall—floor seating, and a wraparound balcony—with an American-flag-draped stage. “It was a great occasion,” Du Bois wrote to Nina.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nMoore opened the program by telling the audience that the Forum Council itself “takes no stand on any questions whatsoever.” That is, the question of whether black people were inferior to whites and therefore not entitled to full equality remained open. Moore himself was white. He asked the audience to refrain from applause. Then he introduced Du Bois, “one of the ablest speakers for his race not only in America but in the whole wide world,” and Stoddard, “whose books and writings and speaking have made his views known to many hundreds of thousands of people both in this country and abroad.”\n\nDu Bois steps to the lectern. He begins by asking what exactly “Negroes” are, what “cultural equality” is, and how anyone can be “encouraged” to seek it. He asks why Negroes or anybody else should _not_ be encouraged to seek cultural equality. He allows that maybe in the past Negroes couldn’t have reached it, but since emancipation they have come wonderfully far, an accomplishment that “has few parallels in human history.” For this they had expected to be applauded, he says; but instead white America feared them and said their advance threatened civilization—as if culture were some fixed quantity, and Negroes’ having more of it would mean less of it for others.\n\nDu Bois points out that such a view imagines culture as if it were material goods, the best of which belong to only the few who have leisure to enjoy them; and then these people begin to see the universe as made specially for them, and elect themselves as the “Chosen People”; and then they think that if the darker races come forward they “are going to spoil the divine gifts of the Nordics.” But there is no scientific proof that modern culture came from Nordics, or that Nordic brains are better. “In fact,” Du Bois says, “the proofs of essential human equality of gift are overwhelming.”\n\nHe says that if Nordics believe themselves to be superior, and do not want to mingle their blood with that of other races, who is forcing them? They can keep to themselves if they wish. He begins to thunder:\n\n> But this has never been the Nordic program. Their program is the subjection and rulership of the world for the benefit of the Nordics. They have overrun the earth and brought not simply modern civilization and technique, but with it exploitation, slavery and degradation to the majority of men. . . . They have been responsible for more intermixture of races than any other people, ancient and modern, and they have inflicted this miscegenation on helpless unwilling slaves by force, fraud and insult; and this is the folk that today has the impudence to turn on the darker races, when they demand a share of civilization, and cry: “You shall not marry our daughters!”\n>\n> The blunt, crude reply is: Who in Hell asked to marry your daughters?\n\nDu Bois says that what black, brown, and yellow people do want is to have the barriers to equal citizenship torn down—“the demand is so reasonable and logical that to deny it is not simply to hurt and hinder them, it is to fly in the face of your own white civilization.” He scores the senselessness of racial categories, in which a mixed-race person like himself could as easily be considered a Nordic as a Negro. The hypocrisy gets worse, he says, when America, “a great white nation with a magnificent Plan of Salvation,” tosses out Christian behavior in dealing with issues of race: “The attacks that white people themselves have made upon their own moral structure are worse for civilization than anything that any body of Negroes could ever do.”\n\nThen he asks the world of white supremacy a practical question: If it really intends to keep other races in subjection—can it? The white exploiters can’t even get along among themselves, as was demonstrated by the recent war, which was “a matter of jealousy in the division of the spoils of Asia and Africa, and by it you nearly ruined civilization.”\n\nStoddard goes next. Having been praised by the moderator for his courage in appearing in a venue where Du Bois has so many supporters, Stoddard begins, “Nothing is more unfortunate than delusion. The Negro has been the victim of delusion ever since the Civil War.” He does not warn the audience against being swept away by his mulatto opponent, nor does he say (as he has already written elsewhere) that white Americans would rather see themselves and their children dead than mix with black people. Du Bois is surprised by the weakness of his performance, and later attributes it to Stoddard’s being too cautious to state frankly what he believes.\n\nStoddard outlines a solution, which he calls “bi-racialism”—a “separate but equal” setup, which he says will be based not on any inherent inferiority but merely on racial “difference.” He says that white people don’t want to mix with Asians, either, although they don’t find Asians inferior—just “different.” He uses the famous metaphor of the hand, first proposed by [Booker T. Washington](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/02/02/the-wizard)—that “in all things purely social [the races] can be as separate as the fingers; yet one as the hand in all things essential to mutual progress.”\n\nThe defining moment of the debate occurs as Stoddard describes how bi-racialism will provide each race with its own public sphere. The Forum Council later printed the debate in a small book, which records the moment. Stoddard says:\n\n> The more enlightened men of southern white America . . . are doing their best to see that separation shall not mean discrimination; that if the Negroes have separate schools, they shall be good schools; that if they have separate train accommodations, they shall have good accommodations. [laughter]\n\nThere is just that one bracketed word, “laughter.” The transcription is being polite. Blacks who had moved to Chicago from the South knew the Jim Crow cars. The absurd notion that Jim Crow cars were anything except horrible—dirty, crowded, inconvenient, degrading—got a huge laugh. As the reporter for the Baltimore _Afro-American_ put it:\n\n> A good-natured burst of laughter from all parts of the hall interrupted Mr. Stoddard when, in explaining his bi-racial theory and attempting to show that it did not mean discrimination, said that under such a system there would be the same kind of schools for Negroes, but separate, the same kind of railway coaches, but separate. . . . When the laughter had subsided, Mr. Stoddard, in a manner of mixed humility and courage, claimed that he could not see the joke. This brought more gales of laughter.\n\nDu Bois, in his rebuttal, says the reason that Stoddard does not understand why the audience laughed is that he has never ridden in a Jim Crow car. He adds, “We have.” Stoddard, when his turn comes again, scolds the audience, saying that real progress is being made in bi-racialism, and “that you have something that you cannot laugh down, that you cannot sneer at, that you cannot be cynical about.” But it is too late; he is fighting a rear-guard action. Du Bois ends by wondering whether the mistake that white supremacists make is believing that civilization is a gift bestowed by an élite, and not derived from “the masses of ordinary people.” With the moderator’s final thanks, the event tapers off in politeness, obscuring the fact that Stoddard has been more or less laughed off the stage.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nNews of Du Bois’s victory spread fast. “DuBois Shatters Stoddard’s Cultural Theories in Debate; Thousands Jam Hall . . . Cheered As He Proves Race Equality,” the _Defender’s_ front-page headline ran. “5,000 Cheer W.E.B. DuBois, Laugh at Lothrop Stoddard,” the _Afro-American_ blared. Soon came requests that the debate be repeated in other Northern cities. The idea of watching the champion of white supremacy get shot down by a brilliant black debater had great appeal. If Stoddard had been willing, the two might have sold out halls across the country. In the process, the lunacy of his theories might have been laid bare, and the Nazis who later used Stoddard and Grant and other American racists to justify the crimes of the Third Reich might have had less to work with.\n\nTo requests for more debates, Du Bois replied that he was willing, but doubted whether Stoddard would agree. Eventually, Du Bois received confirmation from the director of a lecturers’ agency: “Lothrop Stoddard does not want to debate you again.” But great debates must be repeated in order to be remembered; Lincoln and Douglas, Kennedy and Nixon did not debate each other only once.\n\nStoddard had his dignity to think of. In 1929, white supremacists were not often the subjects of jokes. Look through anthologies of humor pieces from the period, and you will not find parodies of nuts like him and Grant, although you will find dialect pieces making fun of blacks. Du Bois knew that the racists would be unintentionally funny onstage; as he wrote to Moore, Senator Heflin “would be a scream” in a debate. Du Bois let the overconfident and bombastic Stoddard walk into a comic moment, which Stoddard then made even funnier by not getting the joke.\n\nAt that instant in Chicago, the black audience saw over the horizon of humor. Were there a History of Modern Laughing, the word “[laughter],” in the debate transcript, would be its opening exhibit. Back then, the comic potential of Nazis remained eons away from discovery. In 1939, Stoddard went to Germany as a correspondent for a national news service and sent back pro-Nazi stories that ran in dozens of papers, including the _Times_ and the Boston _Globe_. His upbeat dispatches remarked on Goebbels’s “quick smile” and the greater warmth and friendliness of Mussolini as compared to Hitler. The stories read like comedy sketches today.\n\nPlenty of Grant’s and Stoddard’s contemporaries rejected their blather, but I can find no other record of them being made figures of fun. Decades of miserable history had to pass before the comedy buried within their malignity was revealed, like a vein of ore uncovered by a natural catastrophe. The best example of Grant-Stoddard-based comedy comes midway through Stanley Kubrick’s masterpiece “[Dr. Strangelove](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-half-century-anniversary-of-dr-strangelove),” from 1964, when Peter Sellers, as Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, a British officer, is talking to his American superior, Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper. The general has just sent a B-52 squadron to drop nuclear bombs on Russia; the end of the world is minutes away, and Mandrake is trying to get Ripper to tell him the planes’ recall code.\n\nRipper talks of a supposed Communist plot to put fluoride in drinking water, soup, and ice cream—in order, he says, to pollute and degrade “our precious bodily fluids.” Mandrake asks how he developed this theory. Ripper replies, “I first became aware of it, Mandrake, during the physical act of love.” The look Sellers gives him at this juncture reaches the peak of movie comedy. “Our precious bodily fluids” is certainly the direct descendant of the vaunted Nordic “germ-plasm.” The supposedly life-generating secret of the Nordics never generated any real offspring except the deranged General Ripper’s “precious bodily fluids.”\n\nStoddard died in 1950, at the age of sixty-six. Like Grant, he was mostly forgotten. Flacking for the Nazis turned out to be a bad career move. But a ghostly image of him survives, in the early pages of “[The Great Gatsby](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FC0PDA/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1).” Nick Carraway, the narrator, has just remet Tom and Daisy Buchanan, his old friends. They are at dinner when something Nick says gets a rise out of Tom:\n\n> “Civilization’s going to pieces,” broke out Tom violently. “I’ve gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read ‘The Rise of the Colored Empires’ by this man Goddard?”\n\nTom informs them that they’re all Nordics: “And we’ve produced all the things that go to make civilization—oh, science and art, and all that. Do you see?” Nick finds the outburst pathetic, “as if his complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more.” The magical Nordics, originators of all civilization: through the reference to Stoddard (and the “G” in “Goddard” can stand for “Grant”), we get a revealing glimpse of Tom. Fitzgerald, a fellow Scribner author, may also be taking a jab at Maxwell Perkins, Scribner’s most important editor, for publishing “The Rising Tide of Color” and the rest of the evil nonsense that was bringing in money for his company.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nMadison Grant’s last address, 960 Fifth Avenue, overlooks Central Park from East Seventy-seventh Street. The building may be the one that stood there in Grant’s lifetime, or not. It lacks a cornerstone with a date, and is not forthcoming in any other way, after the manner of Upper East Side buildings whose only tight-lipped message is that you, the passerby, could never live there. I sometimes imagine Grant or Stoddard coming back to life in New York City, looking at the many people on the street who don’t resemble them, and asking, “What war did we lose?”\n\nThe American Museum of Natural History is directly across the Park from 960 Fifth Avenue, so I wandered over to it. Grant was a longtime trustee of the museum, and I thought it might still hold a few traces of him. In the Hall of North American Mammals, I located the Grant caribou—two males with large antlers, standing on the tundra in Alaska. Metal letters on a baseboard say “Gift of Madison Grant.” Two young guys, one with a ponytail, noticed me looking and asked me who Madison Grant was. I tried to tell them about Grant, and about “The Passing of the Great Race.” The ponytail guy nodded his head and then began to talk about people who give women misinformation about the development of fetuses in order to persuade them to have abortions, and how the Masons and the Illuminati were originally involved in this scheme.\n\nI took the subway up to the Bronx Zoo, where groups of day-camp kids were testing the calm of crossing guards. I recalled that Grant was not the first bad man to frequent this part of the Bronx. Just east of the zoo, a waterfall drops maybe fifteen feet from a placid stretch of the Bronx River. For centuries, the falls powered mills; in the seventeen-hundreds they were owned by the De Lancey family. During the Revolution, the De Lanceys sided with the British. James De Lancey, a rogue son, led a rapacious group of Loyalists and terrorized the countryside. If he felt like hanging someone, he hanged him. In 1783, when George Washington, having won the war, came riding through what’s now the Bronx, and James De Lancey and his men had fled, something basically if imperfectly good replaced something basically if imperfectly evil—as simple as that.\n\nDe Lancey’s mills are long gone. A small park now borders the river at the falls. I walked into the park, thirsty in the heat, and asked a young man on a bench if he had noticed a drinking fountain around. “Yes, I think I saw one,” he said, with a French accent. I asked if he was from the neighborhood, and he said that he and his family were visiting from Réunion, an island in the southern Indian Ocean, near Mauritius. He said that they had flown here, twenty hours on airplanes, by way of Paris.\n\nHe led me to the fountain. My thoughts had been warping with the latest evil nonsense in the news, which was aimed that day at immigrants. In the latest iteration, American citizens were being told to go back where they came from. An entire city, Greenville, North Carolina, seemed to be chanting the evil nonsense. Before I took a drink, I thanked the man from Réunion and said, “I hope you move here.”\n\nHe smiled a wide smile, from one side of his face to the other. I don’t often see anyone smile like that nowadays. “Yes,” he said. “Maybe.”\n\nDuring the debate, Stoddard had insisted that “white America is resolved not to abolish the color line.” In time, Du Bois accepted that this was true. Nonetheless, after Pearl Harbor he said that blacks should enlist, support the war effort, and work for the integration of the military. In 1951, authorities indicted him in connection with an international peace organization that he had chaired. They charged him with being an unregistered agent of a foreign government; the Justice Department thought he was taking money from the Soviet Union. During his arraignment, officers handcuffed the eighty-two-year-old peace activist. At his trial, eight months later, the judge tossed out the case.\n\nIn the late fifties, Du Bois, soon to become an avowed Communist, spent time in the Soviet Union, went to China, and met with Mao. In the sixties, he moved to Ghana, renounced his citizenship, and became a Ghanaian citizen. He died there on August 27, 1963, the day before the March on Washington.\n\nAt a tribute to Du Bois at Carnegie Hall in 1968, Martin Luther King, Jr., said:\n\n> One idea he insistently taught was that black people have been kept in oppression and deprivation by a poisonous fog of lies that depicted them as inferior, born deficient and deservedly doomed to servitude to the grave. . . . Dr. Du Bois recognized that the keystone in the arch of oppression was the myth of inferiority and he dedicated his brilliant talents to demolish it.\n\nIn 1923, Du Bois received a letter from a man named Madison Jackson. Jackson has just read “The Rising Tide of Color.” He tells Du Bois, “I am a layman and an ordinary workman . . . but I am a reader, and I think.” The book’s lies about blacks have troubled him. He asks Du Bois to write a rebuttal of the book.\n\nDu Bois answered the letter. He tells Jackson that _The Crisis_ (i.e., Du Bois himself) will be dealing with the subjects in the book. He reassures him, “Lothrop Stoddard has no standing as a sociologist. He is simply a popular writer who has some vogue just now.” ♦\n\n","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1d787e716b454591ae9d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Eugenics","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"eugenics"},{"id":"5c2e1d50b75f002c8941e54e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"White Supremacy","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"white-supremacy"},{"id":"5c2e1c7bb75f002c8941e471","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Racism","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"racism"},{"id":"5c2fa8a35b0bef2942ea80c2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books"},{"id":"5c2e1fc901de442c9e3e60a7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Daniel Okrent","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"daniel-okrent"},{"id":"5c2e1c94b75f002c8941e49c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"History","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"history"},{"id":"5c2e1f2281ab3335f580f3ad","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Debates","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"debates"}],"sections":[{"id":"591baef1349d4f46aa0520ac","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"American Chronicles","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"american-chronicles"}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a0de4c14b3c606c109f7f","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Ian Frazier is a staff writer at _The New Yorker_.

The structure, designed by the architects David Adjaye, Philip Freelon, and J. Max Bond, Jr., was inspired by Yoruban crowns from West Africa, with the openings in the lattice meant to invite in the sunlight. “The openness to light is symbolic for a museum that seeks to stimulate open dialogue about race and help promote reconciliation and healing,” the museum’s Web site says. The museum faced an impossible task when it opened, in 2016: representing blackness in America—a task that has become more complex in the past few years, as the White House has changed from a symbol of progress to one of regression.\n\nThis September marked the third anniversary of the N.M.A.A.H.C., which is the culmination of several decades of advocacy for a museum dedicated to black life and achievement in America. On the day of its anniversary, the museum was swarmed with kids on field trips. Adults helicoptered overhead, trying to direct and focus the attention of their charges. They ventured through the main attraction, the History Galleries, which comprise a serpentine path through a trio of exhibits that trace black American history from its roots, in Africa and the Caribbean, through slavery, several wars, and the civil-rights movement, culminating with a large photo of [Barack Obama’s Inauguration](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/02/02/a-place-called-hope), as if to say we’ve arrived at the ultimate sign of progress. The design of the exhibits, interconnected and accessible only by elevator, forces you through the chronology. The message: you can’t just skip around through such a history. \n\nBut a walk-through reveals some curious quirks in the telling of this account. A display about slavery in various areas of America oddly puts a year on the first conception of race: “Africans were ultimately defined as ‘enslaved for life,’ and the concept of whiteness began to develop.” Some descriptions are overly tidy in their language, such as this cleaned-up description of rape: “Intimate relationships in the Chesapeake crossed color lines. Some were consensual, others were not. Enslaved women were subjected to the sexual demands of white slave owners.” And, in other places, the passive voice shrinks away from any form of indictment (African-Americans “received no recognition or payment for what they created”), and racism is described like a naturally occurring phenomenon (“This unease over slavery created dangerous new forms of racism”). Accounts of colonialism, prejudice, and abuse sound watered down and, in some cases, untethered from their perpetrators, so that the state of black America almost feels like an inevitability.\n\nThe central question that the museum presents is the degree to which a national memorial to the history and culture of a marginalized people, set in that nation’s capital and funded and supported by that nation’s federal government, can hold the nation accountable to not just its past but its present situation. One room in the History Galleries opens to a vision of lines from the Declaration of Independence. Front and center is a statue of Thomas Jefferson; beneath him, a sign says “The Paradox of Liberty,” alongside a caption: “The paradox of the American Revolution—the fight for liberty in an era of widespread slavery—is embedded in the foundations of the United States.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This paradox was embedded in national institutions that are still vital today.” Some of Jefferson’s belongings, like his glasses and pen holder from Monticello, stand alongside a display of shackles, with a note saying that Jefferson enslaved his own children with [Sally Hemings](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/09/22/president-toms-cabin). In another section, the museum nods toward D.C.’s specific history with slavery: “Washington, D.C., has long reflected the paradox of America’s ideals of freedom and democracy as related to African Americans. In the nation’s capital, a slave market thrived for decades. Black laborers, enslaved and free, helped build the White House and the Capitol building.”\n\n+++inline-recirc\n+++\n\nIn some cases, such language feels like enough. Direct. Educational. Aware of our nation’s hypocrisy. One doesn’t go to museums for invective or censure—at least not the Smithsonians, in our capital. But the N.M.A.A.H.C., with its essential role as a monument to black struggle and achievement in America, aims to faithfully represent blackness in America, though in a manner that does not present the full force of its rage and the full range of its experience. How black, exactly, can the museum be? And whom is this history for? Much of the African-American history in the museum is presented with the assumption that those bearing witness to it are outside of that experience. There’s the risk of othering black experiences, even exoticizing them. “Barbershops have long held an important role in African American communities, not only as a source of cultural expression but also as spaces for sharing information about current events,” a caption in a Hip Hop Photography exhibit says, with the slight tone of a nature documentary. In another place, “Community spaces such as this beauty salon are common settings for AAVE [African-American Vernacular English].” One display, called “Movement: Gesture and Social Dance,” describes black movement as if it’s charting the behaviors of a zoo animal: “Many African Americans stand, walk, dance, and communicate in gestures that set them apart. Some of these movements express the marks of blackness—liberation, creativity, improvisation, and self-determination—from the time of slavery to now. African American gestures can be quiet and illusive, or vibrant and confident.” The examples include various “gestures”: “gestures of solidarity,” “gestures of respect,” “gestures of play,” and more. A photo of crips throwing up their gang sign sits above a photo and explanation of dapping and another of Michelle and Barack Obama fist-bumping. \n\nThe display is one of many on the fourth floor of the museum, in the Culture Galleries, a vibrant collection of exhibits on African-American culture, with memorabilia and descriptions of black musicians, actors, comedians, and more. There are chronicles of black dances and fashion, with door-knocker earrings featured alongside a Fubu jean jacket and pairs of Adidas and Air Jordans, seemingly plucked right out of the eighties and nineties, recent enough that they, too, feel like anthropological tokens of contemporary blackness, set out for display for a primarily white gaze. Even the museum’s restaurant, the Sweet Home Café, then takes on the tint of an interactive tourist exhibit: *try cornbread, fried chicken, and macaroni and cheese for a taste of blackness. Chew over this bit of blackness, and let it bring you closer.* \n\nOn September 24, 2016, celebrities and politicians celebrated the N.M.A.A.H.C. in a grand-opening ceremony. Obama, in his dedication speech, spoke of the museum with his signature blend of hopefulness and awareness of the occasion’s more complex politics. “This is the place to understand how protest and love of country don’t merely coexist but inform each other, how men can proudly win the gold for their country but still insist on raising a black-gloved fist, how we can wear an ‘I can’t breathe’ T-shirt and still grieve for fallen police officers,” he said. But “a museum alone will not alleviate poverty in every inner city,” or “eliminate gun violence,” or “insure that justice is always color-blind,” he continued. Jim Crow isn’t “ancient history”; “it was just yesterday.” “We shouldn’t despair that it’s not all solved,” he said. “And knowing the largest stories should instead remind us just how remarkable the changes that have taken place truly are—just in my lifetime. And thereby inspire us to further progress.” \n\nMuch has changed in the three years since the museum’s opening. When Obama delivered his speech, we were just a few short weeks away from the [2016 Presidential election](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/an-american-tragedy-2). [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump)—who in the seventies violated the [Fair Housing Act](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-unfulfilled-promise-of-the-fair-housing-act) to avoid renting to black tenants, who ran an ad demanding the death penalty for the wrongly accused [Central Park Five](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-central-park-five-criminal-justice-and-donald-trump) (and still maintained that they were guilty in 2016), who tweeted just this summer that several black and brown representatives of Congress should [“go back” to their countries](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/trumps-racist-tweets-and-the-question-of-who-belongs-in-america), and who has committed a string of other racist offenses—was elected President.\n\n+++feature-small\n[#image: /photos/5daf3444943704000af788d0]||||||\n+++\n\nIn the past few years, the museum has responded to [Black Lives Matter](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/black-lives-matter) by curating items from and documenting the movement, bridging its presentation of African-American history with a realistic look at contemporary black life in America. And there are brief moments in its current exhibits when it makes the same connections. A display about the history of Angola, the plantation turned prison, reads “In a country with the world’s highest incarceration rate, where African Americans are imprisoned at six times the rate of white Americans, Angola also provides a crucial contemporary lens through which all Americans can focus on race, equality, and the criminal justice system.” In an exhibit about African-Americans in sports, a display reads “Although football was the first of the major team sports to re-integrate, it has lagged far behind others in promoting African Americans into coaching and management positions.” But the extent to which the museum touches the politics of the present is, understandably, limited. \n\nHarriet Tubman’s lace shawl and hymnal are featured, but they may also bring to mind Trump’s opposition to replacing the notoriously racist Andrew Jackson with Tubman as the face on the [twenty-dollar bill](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-haunted-image-of-harriet-tubman-on-the-twenty-dollar-bill). Minstrel dolls and puppets, with information about damaging black stereotypes and blackface, are featured, but they may also bring to mind the [enduring](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/arts/blackface-american-pop-culture.html) [popularity](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/02/16/lengthy-history-white-politicians-who-wore-blackface-got-pass/) of blackface and brownface even today. Though the N.M.A.A.H.C. aims to highlight African-American history, daily the repercussions of that history make themselves felt in new ways to black Americans. Those past injustices and abuses are ingrained in the institutions that shape our lives and so continue to color the entirety of our experience.\n\nThe museum’s proximity to the White House, home to a black President when it opened but now to a President who has sympathized with white supremacists, somewhat dwarfs its stature. In his [memoir](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1588346684?ie=UTF8&tag=washpost-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=1588346684), released last month, also on the third anniversary of the N.M.A.A.H.C.’s opening, the founding director, Lonnie G. Bunch III, writes of the disappointing experience he had when Trump visited the museum and attacks the Administration for its “combative relationship with many in the African American community.” But he also writes that many have found the museum to be a balm since the election. “Many visitors have told me that since the election in 2016, the museum has gained even greater significance,” Bunch writes. “To some, visiting the museum allows them to find the solace, inspiration and hope that the current poisonous political partisanship and racial antipathy will one day be overcome.” \n\nThe walls of the N.M.A.A.H.C. are covered with quotes from the greats: [Martin Luther King, Jr.](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/09/honoring-martin-luther-king-jr-fifty-years-after-his-death), [Maya Angelou](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/08/05/songbird), [Langston Hughes](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-black-clown-beautifully-reconfigures-a-langston-hughes-poem), [Toni Morrison](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/postscript/toni-morrisons-truth), and more. Tokens of wisdom from figures of peaceful resistance and from men and women of arts and letters exist alongside the footprints of more firebrand revolutionaries—pictures of [Black Panthers](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-most-important-legacy-of-the-black-panthers) and Stokely Carmichael, video of [Malcolm X](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/04/25/this-american-life), a poem by [Amiri Baraka](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-path-cleared-by-amiri-baraka)—in a space that cannot fully represent, or atone for, the continued injustices and prejudices of the country. But it’s an act of folly to expect reparations, in any sense, from a museum. As Obama said in his dedication speech, three years ago, it’s neither the museum’s role nor responsibility to account for America, nor its intention to provide itself as a vessel for the comprehensive body of the black experience in America. Neither can the museum provide a view of blackness, for blackness, without accounting for those who exist outside of it.\n\nThe result is an institution that exists in a liminal space, attempting to be both specific to but greater than a singular racial experience, both historical and savvy to the present moment. For years, many fought for such an institution, the beauty and relevance of which is undeniable, where I witnessed, among the clamor of schoolchildren, a woman with skinny dreadlocks quietly weeping in front of an exhibition of a slave cabin—unceremoniously blotting her nose and eyes as she continued on through the space. In some sense, the museum, by design, by the limits of its perspective, will always be a failure. In another, in the spaces where the black visitors lingered, looking at their ancestry, and where white visitors passed respectfully, silently, noting their own position in the history—a shared history that implicates all of us in this America—the museum was and will continue to be a success. This duplicity is, as the museum called it, part of the American paradox: a museum that represents both stagnancy and change, advancement and retrogression, black America and the rest.

I. (Si) Newhouse (whose family owns Condé Nast, which publishes *The New Yorker*), and its C.E.O., Robert Bernstein, who had hired me away from the Washington *Post*. We were in the Bahamas, at a sales conference. Newhouse was ordinarily a quiet, phlegmatic man, I had been told, but on one subject he was very animated: Donald Trump. By then, Trump, who had recently completed the construction of a shimmering tower on Fifth Avenue, had been around for a decade. A profile in the *Times*, in 1976, had called him New York’s “No. 1” real-estate promoter. “He is tall, lean and blond,” the story noted, “and he looks ever so much like Robert Redford.” More recently, at the suggestion of Roy Cohn, the notorious New York lawyer and fixer, who had been Newhouse’s close friend since their days together at the Horace Mann School, Trump had appeared on the cover of *GQ*, a Condé Nast magazine. The issue had sold especially well. \n\nThis Trump fellow, Newhouse now said, was more than a comer. He had arrived. The word was that Newhouse was hands-off when it came to acquiring books, but on this occasion he emphatically was not. He said, “Let’s do a book with Trump.” I had been brought to Random House to acquire and edit, among other things, high-profile books by public figures. Newhouse said that he would arrange a meeting with Trump, and it was decided that Howard Kaminsky, the new publisher of the Random House trade division, and I would accompany him. Kaminsky was a friend of Newhouse and was clearly his choice as publisher, not Bernstein’s. \n\nThe day of the meeting arrived, and we were led into Trump’s office, on the twenty-sixth floor of Trump Tower, by his personal assistant, an elegant woman named Norma Foerderer. (She would later have an assistant of her own, Rhona Graff, who is still Trump’s personal assistant in New York.) The office had a spectacular view of Central Park and the Plaza Hotel, which Trump coveted. The walls were covered with magazine spreads he’d appeared in and some plaques. There was a large phone console, but Trump summoned Norma and others with a shout.\n\nNewhouse made the pitch. We had brought along a cover proposal––black background, a photograph of Trump, and his name and the title in gold letters. Trump liked the cover but said his name should be larger. It wasn’t clear to me whether he was being serious or engaging in self-parody. In any case, by the end of the meeting, Trump was ready to do the book. We soon learned that a writer named Tony Schwartz, who had worked at *Newsweek* and the *Times*, had come to Trump with a concept for a book they could do together, to be called “The Art of The Deal.” All the pieces were in place. The advance was five hundred thousand dollars, to be split evenly, from the first dollar, with Schwartz as the co-author. I don’t remember dealing with either an agent or a lawyer.\n\nIt was now 1985 and I was acquiring other books, including the memoirs of House Speaker Tip O’Neill, and Rosalynn and Jimmy Carter’s “[Everything to Gain: Making the Most of the Rest of Your Life](https://www.amazon.com/Everything-Gain-Making-Most-Rest/dp/1557283885).” I also contracted with Natan Sharansky, a Russian-Jewish dissident I had known while working as a reporter for the *Post* in Moscow, a decade earlier. We had both been attacked by Soviet authorities: he for supposedly being a spy and I for supposedly being his American handler. Sharansky was tried for treason and went to prison for nine years. When he was released, in 1986, Bernstein, a staunch human-rights activist, flew with me to Israel to meet him and sign him up.\n\nI was still learning how to be a book editor and publisher. With O’Neill and the Carters, I was a reporter as well as an editor, asking questions and reviewing interview transcripts. When Sharansky had a draft, I went to Israel again and he read it to me in Russian. The Trump process, however, was quite different. In 2016, [Tony Schwartz told Jane Mayer](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/donald-trumps-ghostwriter-tells-all) that he now deeply regrets being Trump’s writer. But he was not a “ghostwriter” exactly, certainly not an anonymous one. His name got full billing on the cover. I have no reason to doubt that Schwartz is sincere in his chagrin, but he did do a masterly job on the book. He shadowed Trump, channelled his stories, and made the narrative readable. He presented Trump in the best possible way—the way Trump wanted to be seen. Tony left very little for an editor to do.\n\nInstead, my responsibility became all the publishing elements: how the book looked, how it would be marketed and publicized. I became the Random House sponsor of what we thought would be a significant seller during the holiday buying season of 1987. Kaminsky would normally have been at the helm of our efforts, but in October, 1987, he was fired by Bernstein, who had kept a distinct distance from the project. Kaminsky’s successor was Joni Evans, who came from Simon & Schuster. While she was getting her bearings at Random House, I was the point person on “The Art of the Deal.”\n\nI accompanied Trump to meetings with the heads of major book-retail chains, the biggest of which at that time was Waldenbooks, which had more than a thousand stores in malls and storefronts around the country. The C.E.O. was Harry Hoffman, a big man with considerable self-regard, who tended to think that publishers were fusty and backward in their understanding of how books should be sold. Over lunch at some swank French restaurant in midtown Manhattan, I watched Hoffman and Trump bond. They agreed that they could make “The Art of the Deal” a No. 1 best-seller.\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThe book party took place in December, 1987, in the atrium of Trump Tower. It was a black-tie affair, with photographers and spotlights everywhere. On the receiving line, standing next to Trump, Newhouse, and Schwartz, I found myself shaking hands with Mike Tyson, Barbara Walters, Barry Diller, and Norman Mailer, who had been, surprisingly, a close friend of Roy Cohn. I gave the celebratory toast. The mood was jubilant. At that very moment, my wife, Susan, was in Moscow with a delegation from Human Rights Watch, where she worked, meeting with prominent dissidents who were under the surveillance of the K.G.B. Susan and I have been a couple since the early seventies. Never in our marriage can it be said that we were farther apart, in terms of both distance and circumstance.\n\nThe book went to No. 1 and stayed there. The media interest from the outset was intense. The top shows of the time—Phil Donahue in daytime, Larry King at night, and everyone in between, including programs in the United Kingdom—were eager to book New York’s glamorous young real-estate mogul. Random House had put out about a hundred and twenty-five thousand copies in the first printing. They disappeared very quickly. Reprints were ordered and shipped on an almost daily basis to keep up with demand. Trump was thrilled. Schwartz, on the other hand, was frustrated to learn that some booksellers were out of stock. He had stores on speed dial and would report shortages back to us in furious calls. I’ve always believed that of the book’s two credited authors, Schwartz was the more frenetic. Given the fifty-fifty split in the contract, he was on the way to making a fortune in royalties.\n\nThere was a rumor adrift that Trump was buying his own book to boost his sales numbers, which seems unlikely: Trump doesn’t spend money when he doesn’t have to. He was hardly passive, however. Joni Evans told me that Trump called her at home a few days before Christmas to say that he wanted a thousand copies delivered to Aspen for his upcoming ski vacation. \n\n“Donald, it’s Christmas,” she said. “All the warehouses are closed.” \n\n“Figure it out,” was his command. He offered the use of his plane.\n\nEvans managed to reach Newhouse. The warehouse was mobilized. The copies reached Aspen and were sold. By mid-1988, “The Art of the Deal” had sold a million hardcover copies.\n\nThrough all this, my relations with Trump were smooth. He was so glad to have been solicited by Newhouse, and he had, in an easy climb, become a national celebrity. The *Times* review ended with this notable sentence: “Mr. Trump makes one believe even for a moment in the American dream.” Then there was this ambiguous closing line: “It’s like a fairy tale.”\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThe following spring, my son, [Evan](https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/evan-osnos), who was then about twelve years old, expressed a fascination with professional wrestling. There was a World Wrestling Federation extravaganza coming up in Atlantic City. This was a Trump-promoted event. I called Trump’s office, spoke to Norma, and was sent three free tickets. On the day of the event, Trump arrived at the arena to wild applause. This was well before his days on “The Apprentice,” but he was already at least as big a star as Hulk Hogan or whoever was in the ring that day.\n\nAs was probably inevitable, either Trump or Newhouse eventually proposed doing a sequel to “The Art of the Deal.” And so the planning began. Newhouse and I were invited to lunch on Trump’s yacht, the Trump Princess, a two-hundred-and-eighty-foot vessel that he’d bought from the Sultan of Brunei. The Trump Princess was anchored in the East River. What I most remember was that, by dessert, Newhouse had authorized an advance of two and a half million dollars, five times what we had paid for the first book. Once again, I was to be the editor.\n\nAt the time, I sensed that Trump’s world was starting to darken. In October, 1989, three of his top casino executives were killed in a helicopter crash. When I expressed my condolences to Trump, he replied, as I recall, “You know, I was supposed to be on that chopper.” Then word spread that Trump and Ivana’s marriage was faltering, despite her executive role in his recent acquisition of the Plaza. There was reportedly a new woman in his life, but her identity had yet to be revealed. Trump was still opening casinos in Atlantic City, most notably the Taj Mahal, but there were rumors that he was becoming overstretched.\n\nBy the end of May, 1990, we had a manuscript in draft. (Schwartz was unavailable, so we recruited Charles Leerhsen, a gifted *Newsweek* writer who had co-authored the memoirs of the pilot Chuck Yeager.) The only time I ever saw Trump lose his temper came when we sent a photographer to do a cover picture in his office at Trump Tower. Arriving early, the photographer attached black garbage bags to the ceiling, in order to reduce glare. When Trump saw the bags, he demanded that they be removed and angrily told the photographer that he would be charged for any damage to the paint job. The photograph that we eventually chose was of Trump tossing an apple into the air. The text on the back of the jacket said, “This is Phase Two of my life, in which the going gets a lot tougher and the victories, because they are harder won, seem all the sweeter.… I know that whatever happens, I’m a survivor—a survivor of success, which is a very rare thing indeed.”\n\nThe big annual convention of publishers and booksellers was in Las Vegas that year, in early June. Trump was invited to be a speaker at a breakfast at which about three thousand people would be in attendance. The night before, Random House hosted a reception for about a thousand people at the Mirage hotel, in honor of Trump and of the novelist Jean Auel and her “Clan of the Cave Bear” series.\n\nI was to be Trump’s escort at the event. Our arrangements were elaborate. I went to the airport in a stretch limo, and, when Trump exited his jet and settled into the car, he said that he had a surprise. And there was Marla Maples, his secret paramour. At the Mirage, Trump and Maples checked into an enormous suite, which was equipped with its own swimming pool. At the appointed hour, I went to pick him up for the party. Maples opened the door wearing a bikini. \n\nAfter the book party, Trump, Newhouse, Alberto Vitale, who was now the C.E.O. of Random House, Joni Evans, and I went to dinner in a private room with a small group of top-tier booksellers, including the owner of Barnes & Noble, Leonard Riggio, and E. Bronson Ingram and his wife, Martha, the owners of the country’s largest book wholesaler. As we were about to start, Maples appeared. Given that she was still supposed to be incognito, her presence caused a stir.   \n\nEarly the next morning, I picked up a copy of the *Wall Street Journal*, which featured a front-page story about Trump’s finances. To summarize, they were a mess. He was billions of dollars in debt. The *Journal’s* account was, by any measure, a full takedown. At the bookseller breakfast that morning, Trump gave a spirited talk. My assumption was that the only people in the ballroom who had read the *Journal* story were those in the Random House contingent. The enthusiastic audience seemed oblivious.\n\nTrump left the stage and we rushed off to his plane to fly to New York. Vitale whispered to me, in effect, “Get this book out fast. He is a wasting asset.” On the flight, I was watching Trump carefully to see how he was doing. I couldn’t spot a trace of anxiety. I don’t remember anyone mentioning the story or his finances. After a sumptuous lunch of shrimp, charcuterie, and assorted desserts, Trump took Maples into his private cabin and reëmerged about ninety minutes later. Considering the *Journal* story, I would not have been surprised had he opened the jet’s door and jumped out. And yet he seemed unfazed. We landed in early evening.\n\nOur Random House team scrambled to get the book finished and distributed as quickly as possible. The publication date was moved to mid-August. Around that time, I learned that *New York* magazine was planning to run a feature on the book and Trump’s financial and marital dramas. I was asked to provide a picture of myself to accompany the story. My private dread was that the caption would be something like “He edited this dog.” I called Ed Kosner, *New York’s* editor, whom I knew slightly, and asked him if he would leave me out if I could find a better picture than mine to go with the story. He told me to try.\n\nAlong with Carol Schneider, Random House’s publicity director, I studied contact sheets of snapshots taken at the Mirage party. We found one of Trump with Newhouse, Vitale, Evans, and John Updike. That satisfied Kosner, and I was spared, although I was quoted in the piece saying that we had positive expectations for the book, which was to be titled “[Surviving at the Top](https://www.amazon.com/Trump-Surviving-Top-Donald-J/dp/0394575970).” \n\nRandom House shipped hundreds of thousands of copies. Reviews this time were sparse and not altogether friendly. In the *Times*, Michael Lewis wrote that the book was “a portrait of an ego gone haywire.” Nevertheless, the book spent seven weeks in the top fifteen on the *Times* best-seller list. Warner Books bought the paperback rights for a million dollars. (They changed the title to “The Art of Survival” and released it in July, 1991.)\n\nI haven’t looked at the book since, but I found a copy recently and discovered that it included a paragraph excerpted from a *Times* editorial that was published shortly after the *Journal* story about Trump’s finances broke. The paragraph closed: “Arrogance? For sure, and yet in a world lacking individual heroes, even some of Donald’s critics must confess to a sneaking respect for his insistence on being himself, however outrageous, and catch themselves hoping that he’ll find the strength and luck to escape.”\n\nWith “Surviving” now in the past, my regular contacts with Trump came to an end. He continued to flounder in business. In 1990, Trump hired Stephen Bollenbach, who was previously the C.F.O. of the company that owned Holiday Inn, and gave him a mandate to straighten out Trump’s debts. It would be hard to penetrate how Bollenbach undertook this task, but a number of Trump assets, including the Trump Shuttle, the Plaza Hotel, and his yacht were off-loaded. At the time, the word was that Bollenbach put Trump on a four-hundred-and-fifty-thousand-dollar monthly allowance. In two years, Trump was apparently out of the worst trouble. When I asked Trump how he had found Bollenbach and persuaded him to salvage his finances and the standing of the Trump Organization, he said he had read about him in *Businessweek*. Like that.\n\nI am often asked if I regret having been the editor of the book that made Trump a national figure. The answer is no. I was trained in journalism and Trump was a terrific story. I was tasked by Si Newhouse to manage him on that first book. On the second book, I was working with a successful repeat author. A decade or so after the publication of “The Art of the Deal,” I was asked to edit a third Trump opus. By then, I could sense that my time at Random House was coming to an end. I was eager to start a small publishing company called PublicAffairs. I left Random House a year before “The Art of the Comeback” was published, in 1997. And that is a fact that I definitely have never regretted, then or any time since.\n\n*A previous version of this post misidentified an attendee at the book party.*","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1d6322d4972cd5b83371","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1d6322d4972cd5b83371","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Art of the Deal","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"art-of-the-deal"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Art of the Deal","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"art-of-the-deal"}],"sections":[{"id":"5908e08d1c7a8e33fb389287","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5908e08d1c7a8e33fb389287","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Personal History","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"personal-history"},{"id":"590411aa6870945b4d262380","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Culture","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"culture"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"Personal History","parent":[{"id":"590411aa6870945b4d262380","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Culture","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"culture"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"personal-history"},{"id":"5907eefc98449f3364193d6d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5907eefc98449f3364193d6d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Page-Turner","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"page-turner"},{"id":"5908f18c98449f3364193dfd","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"Page-Turner","parent":[{"id":"5908f18c98449f3364193dfd","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"page-turner"}]},"channel":"Culture","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"id":"5db323cf0db2680009f82fd8","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","email":"","name":"Peter Osnos","socialMedia":[],"title":"Peter Osnos is the founder of PublicAffairs Books and a writer in New York.","url":"/contributors/peter-osnos"}],"dek":"What I saw as the editor of “The Art of the Deal,” the book that made the future President millions of dollars and turned him into a national figure.

Trump](http://www.newyorker.com/topics/donald-trump-in-the-new-yorker) had declared his candidacy for President. As Schwartz watched a video of the speech, he began to feel personally implicated.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump, facing a crowd that had gathered in the lobby of Trump Tower, on Fifth Avenue, laid out his qualifications, saying, “We need a leader that wrote ‘The Art of the Deal.’ ” If that was so, Schwartz thought, then he, not Trump, should be running. Schwartz dashed off a tweet: “Many thanks Donald Trump for suggesting I run for President, based on the fact that I wrote ‘The Art of the Deal.’ ”\n\n\n\nSchwartz had ghostwritten Trump’s 1987 breakthrough memoir, earning a joint byline on the cover, half of the book’s five-hundred-thousand-dollar advance, and half of the royalties. The book was a phenomenal success, spending forty-eight weeks on the _Times_ best-seller list, thirteen of them at No. 1. More than a million copies have been bought, generating several million dollars in royalties. The book expanded Trump’s renown far beyond New York City, making him an emblem of the successful tycoon. Edward Kosner, the former editor and publisher of _New York_, where Schwartz worked as a writer at the time, says, “Tony created Trump. He’s Dr. Frankenstein.”\n\n\n\nStarting in late 1985, Schwartz spent eighteen months with Trump—camping out in his office, joining him on his helicopter, tagging along at meetings, and spending weekends with him at his Manhattan apartment and his Florida estate. During that period, Schwartz felt, he had got to know him better than almost anyone else outside the Trump family. Until Schwartz posted the tweet, though, he had not spoken publicly about Trump for decades. It had never been his ambition to be a ghostwriter, and he had been glad to move on. But, as he watched a replay of the new candidate holding forth for forty-five minutes, he noticed something strange: over the decades, Trump appeared to have convinced himself that he _had_ written the book. Schwartz recalls thinking, “If he could lie about that on Day One—when it was so easily refuted—he is likely to lie about anything.”\n\n\n\nIt seemed improbable that Trump’s campaign would succeed, so Schwartz told himself that he needn’t worry much. But, as Trump denounced Mexican immigrants as “rapists,” near the end of the speech, Schwartz felt anxious. He had spent hundreds of hours observing Trump firsthand, and felt that he had an unusually deep understanding of what he regarded as Trump’s beguiling strengths and disqualifying weaknesses. Many Americans, however, saw Trump as a charmingly brash entrepreneur with an unfailing knack for business—a mythical image that Schwartz had helped create. “It pays to trust your instincts,” Trump says in the book, adding that he was set to make hundreds of millions of dollars after buying a hotel that he hadn’t even walked through.\n\n\n\nIn the subsequent months, as Trump defied predictions by establishing himself as the front-runner for the Republican nomination, Schwartz’s desire to set the record straight grew. He had long since left journalism to launch the Energy Project, a consulting firm that promises to improve employees’ productivity by helping them boost their “physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual” morale. It was a successful company, with clients such as Facebook, and Schwartz’s colleagues urged him to avoid the political fray. But the prospect of President Trump terrified him. It wasn’t because of Trump’s ideology—Schwartz doubted that he had one. The problem was Trump’s personality, which he considered pathologically impulsive and self-centered.\n\n\n\nSchwartz thought about publishing an article describing his reservations about Trump, but he hesitated, knowing that, since he’d cashed in on the flattering “Art of the Deal,” his credibility and his motives would be seen as suspect. Yet watching the campaign was excruciating. Schwartz decided that if he kept mum and Trump was elected he’d never forgive himself. In June, he agreed to break his silence and give his first candid interview about the Trump he got to know while acting as his Boswell.\n\n\n\n“I put lipstick on a pig,” he said. “I feel a deep sense of remorse that I contributed to presenting Trump in a way that brought him wider attention and made him more appealing than he is.” He went on, “I genuinely believe that if Trump wins and gets the nuclear codes there is an excellent possibility it will lead to the end of civilization.”\n\n\n\nIf he were writing “The Art of the Deal” today, Schwartz said, it would be a very different book with a very different title. Asked what he would call it, he answered, “The Sociopath.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThe idea of Trump writing an autobiography didn’t originate with either Trump or Schwartz. It began with Si Newhouse, the media magnate whose company, Advance Publications, owned Random House at the time, and continues to own Condé Nast, the parent company of this magazine. “It was very definitely, and almost uniquely, Si Newhouse’s idea,” Peter Osnos, who edited the book, recalls. _GQ_, which Condé Nast also owns, had published a cover story on Trump, and Newhouse noticed that newsstand sales had been unusually strong.\n\n\n\n\n\nNewhouse called Trump about the project, then visited him to discuss it. Random House continued the pursuit with a series of meetings. At one point, Howard Kaminsky, who ran Random House then, wrapped a thick Russian novel in a dummy cover that featured a photograph of Trump looking like a conquering hero; at the top was Trump’s name, in large gold block lettering. Kaminsky recalls that Trump was pleased by the mockup, but had one suggestion: “Please make my name much bigger.” After securing the half-million-dollar advance, Trump signed a contract.\n\n\n\nAround this time, Schwartz, who was one of the leading young magazine writers of the day, stopped by Trump’s office, in Trump Tower. Schwartz had written about Trump before. In 1985, he’d published a piece in _New York_ called “A Different Kind of Donald Trump Story,” which portrayed him not as a brilliant mogul but as a ham-fisted thug who had unsuccessfully tried to evict rent-controlled and rent-stabilized tenants from a building that he had bought on Central Park South. Trump’s efforts—which included a plan to house homeless people in the building in order to harass the tenants—became what Schwartz described as a “fugue of failure, a farce of fumbling and bumbling.” An accompanying cover portrait depicted Trump as unshaven, unpleasant-looking, and shiny with sweat. Yet, to Schwartz’s amazement, Trump loved the article. He hung the cover on a wall of his office, and sent a fan note to Schwartz, on his gold-embossed personal stationery. “Everybody seems to have read it,” Trump enthused in the note, which Schwartz has kept.\n\n\n\n“I was shocked,” Schwartz told me. “Trump didn’t fit any model of human being I’d ever met. He was obsessed with publicity, and he didn’t care what you wrote.” He went on, “Trump only takes two positions. Either you’re a scummy loser, liar, whatever, or you’re the greatest. I became the greatest. He wanted to be seen as a tough guy, and he loved being on the cover.” Schwartz wrote him back, saying, “Of all the people I’ve written about over the years, you are certainly the best sport.”\n\n\n\nAnd so Schwartz had returned for more, this time to conduct an interview for _Playboy_. But to his frustration Trump kept making cryptic, monosyllabic statements. “He mysteriously wouldn’t answer my questions,” Schwartz said. After twenty minutes, he said, Trump explained that he didn’t want to reveal anything new about himself—he had just signed a lucrative book deal and needed to save his best material.\n\n\n\n“What kind of book?” Schwartz said.\n\n\n\n“My autobiography,” Trump replied.\n\n\n\n“You’re only thirty-eight—you don’t have one yet!” Schwartz joked.\n\n\n\n“Yeah, I know,” Trump said.\n\n\n\n“If I were you,” Schwartz recalls telling him, “I’d write a book called ‘The Art of the Deal.’ _That’s_ something people would be interested in.”\n\n\n\n“You’re right,” Trump agreed. “Do you want to write it?”\n\n\n\nSchwartz thought it over for several weeks. He knew that he would be making a Faustian bargain. A lifelong liberal, he was hardly an admirer of Trump’s ruthless and single-minded pursuit of profit. “It was one of a number of times in my life when I was divided between the Devil and the higher side,” he told me. He had grown up in a bourgeois, intellectual family in Manhattan, and had attended élite private schools, but he was not as wealthy as some of his classmates—and, unlike many of them, he had no trust fund. “I grew up privileged,” he said. “But my parents made it clear: ‘You’re on your own.’ ” Around the time Trump made his offer, Schwartz’s wife, Deborah Pines, became pregnant with their second daughter, and he worried that the family wouldn’t fit into their Manhattan apartment, whose mortgage was already too high. “I was overly worried about money,” Schwartz said. “I thought money would keep me safe and secure—or that was my rationalization.” At the same time, he knew that if he took Trump’s money and adopted Trump’s voice his journalism career would be badly damaged. His heroes were such literary nonfiction writers as Tom Wolfe, John McPhee, and David Halberstam. Being a ghostwriter was hackwork. In the end, though, Schwartz had his price. He told Trump that if he would give him half the advance and half the book’s royalties he’d take the job.\n\n\n\nSuch terms are unusually generous for a ghostwriter. Trump, despite having a reputation as a tough negotiator, agreed on the spot. “It was a huge windfall,” Schwartz recalls. “But I knew I was selling out. Literally, the term was invented to describe what I did.” Soon _Spy_ was calling him “former journalist Tony Schwartz.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nSchwartz thought that “The Art of the Deal” would be an easy project. The book’s structure would be simple: he’d chronicle half a dozen or so of Trump’s biggest real-estate deals, dispense some bromides about how to succeed in business, and fill in Trump’s life story. For research, he planned to interview Trump on a series of Saturday mornings. The first session didn’t go as planned, however. After Trump gave him a tour of his marble-and-gilt apartment atop Trump Tower—which, to Schwartz, looked unlived-in, like the lobby of a hotel—they began to talk. But the discussion was soon hobbled by what Schwartz regards as one of Trump’s most essential characteristics: “He has no attention span.”\n\n\n\n\n\nIn those days, Schwartz recalls, Trump was generally affable with reporters, offering short, amusingly immodest quotes on demand. Trump had been forthcoming with him during the _New York_ interview, but it hadn’t required much time or deep reflection. For the book, though, Trump needed to provide him with sustained, thoughtful recollections. He asked Trump to describe his childhood in detail. After sitting for only a few minutes in his suit and tie, Trump became impatient and irritable. He looked fidgety, Schwartz recalls, “like a kindergartner who can’t sit still in a classroom.” Even when Schwartz pressed him, Trump seemed to remember almost nothing of his youth, and made it clear that he was bored. Far more quickly than Schwartz had expected, Trump ended the meeting.\n\n\n\nWeek after week, the pattern repeated itself. Schwartz tried to limit the sessions to smaller increments of time, but Trump’s contributions remained oddly truncated and superficial.\n\n\n\n“Trump has been written about a thousand ways from Sunday, but this fundamental aspect of who he is doesn’t seem to be fully understood,” Schwartz told me. “It’s implicit in a lot of what people write, but it’s never explicit—or, at least, I haven’t seen it. And that is that it’s impossible to keep him focussed on any topic, other than his own self-aggrandizement, for more than a few minutes, and even then . . . ” Schwartz trailed off, shaking his head in amazement. He regards Trump’s inability to concentrate as alarming in a Presidential candidate. “If he had to be briefed on a crisis in the Situation Room, it’s impossible to imagine him paying attention over a long period of time,” he said.\n\n\n\nIn a recent phone interview, Trump told me that, to the contrary, he has the skill that matters most in a crisis: the ability to forge compromises. The reason he touted “The Art of the Deal” in his announcement, he explained, was that he believes that recent Presidents have lacked his toughness and finesse: “Look at the trade deficit with China. Look at the Iran deal. I’ve made a fortune by making deals. I do that. I do that well. That’s what I do.”\n\n\n\nBut Schwartz believes that Trump’s short attention span has left him with “a stunning level of superficial knowledge and plain ignorance.” He said, “That’s why he so prefers TV as his first news source—information comes in easily digestible sound bites.” He added, “I seriously doubt that Trump has ever read a book straight through in his adult life.” During the eighteen months that he observed Trump, Schwartz said, he never saw a book on Trump’s desk, or elsewhere in his office, or in his apartment.\n\n\n\nOther journalists have noticed Trump’s apparent lack of interest in reading. In May, Megyn Kelly, of Fox News, asked him to name his favorite book, other than the Bible or “The Art of the Deal.” Trump picked the 1929 novel “All Quiet on the Western Front.” Evidently suspecting that many years had elapsed since he’d read it, Kelly asked Trump to talk about the most recent book he’d read. “I read passages, I read areas, I’ll read chapters—I don’t have the time,” Trump said. As _The New Republic_ noted recently, this attitude is not shared by most U.S. Presidents, including Barack Obama, a habitual consumer of current books, and George W. Bush, who reportedly engaged in a fiercely competitive book-reading contest with his political adviser Karl Rove.\n\n\n\nTrump’s first wife, Ivana, famously claimed that Trump kept a copy of Adolf Hitler’s collected speeches, “My New Order,” in a cabinet beside his bed. In 1990, Trump’s friend Marty Davis, who was then an executive at Paramount, added credence to this story, telling Marie Brenner, of _Vanity Fair_, that he had given Trump the book. “I thought he would find it interesting,” Davis told her. When Brenner asked Trump about it, however, he mistakenly identified the volume as a different work by Hitler: “Mein Kampf.” Apparently, he had not so much as read the title. “_If_ I had these speeches, and I am not saying that I do, I would never read them,” Trump told Brenner.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nGrowing desperate, Schwartz devised a strategy for trapping Trump into giving more material. He made plans to spend the weekend with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, his mansion in Palm Beach, where there would be fewer distractions. As they chatted in the garden, Ivana icily walked by, clearly annoyed that Schwartz was competing for her husband’s limited free time. Trump again grew impatient. Long before lunch on Saturday, Schwartz recalls, Trump “essentially threw a fit.” He stood up and announced that he couldn’t stand any more questions.\n\n\n\n\n\nSchwartz went to his room, called his literary agent, Kathy Robbins, and told her that he couldn’t do the book. (Robbins confirms this.) As Schwartz headed back to New York, though, he came up with another plan. He would propose eavesdropping on Trump’s life by following him around on the job and, more important, by listening in on his office phone calls. That way, extracting extended reflections from Trump would not be required. When Schwartz presented the idea to Trump, he loved it. Almost every day from then on, Schwartz sat about eight feet away from him in the Trump Tower office, listening on an extension of Trump’s phone line. Schwartz says that none of the bankers, lawyers, brokers, and reporters who called Trump realized that they were being monitored. The calls usually didn’t last long, and Trump’s assistant facilitated the conversation-hopping. While he was talking with someone, she often came in with a Post-it note informing him of the next caller on hold.\n\n\n\n“He was playing people,” Schwartz recalls. On the phone with business associates, Trump would flatter, bully, and occasionally get mad, but always in a calculated way. Before the discussion ended, Trump would “share the news of his latest success,” Schwartz says. Instead of saying goodbye at the end of a call, Trump customarily signed off with “You’re the greatest!” There was not a single call that Trump deemed too private for Schwartz to hear. “He loved the attention,” Schwartz recalls. “If he could have had three hundred thousand people listening in, he would have been even happier.”\n\n\n\nThis year, Schwartz has heard some argue that there must be a more thoughtful and nuanced version of Donald Trump that he is keeping in reserve for after the campaign. “There isn’t,” Schwartz insists. “There is no private Trump.” This is not a matter of hindsight. While working on “The Art of the Deal,” Schwartz kept a journal in which he expressed his amazement at Trump’s personality, writing that Trump seemed driven entirely by a need for public attention. “All he is is ‘stomp, stomp, stomp’—recognition from outside, bigger, more, a whole series of things that go nowhere in particular,” he observed, on October 21, 1986. But, as he noted in the journal a few days later, “the book will be far more successful if Trump is a sympathetic character—even weirdly sympathetic—than if he is just hateful or, worse yet, a one-dimensional blowhard.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nEavesdropping solved the interview problem, but it presented a new one. After hearing Trump’s discussions about business on the phone, Schwartz asked him brief follow-up questions. He then tried to amplify the material he got from Trump by calling others involved in the deals. But their accounts often directly conflicted with Trump’s. “Lying is second nature to him,” Schwartz said. “More than anyone else I have ever met, Trump has the ability to convince himself that whatever he is saying at any given moment is true, or sort of true, or at least _ought_ to be true.” Often, Schwartz said, the lies that Trump told him were about money—“how much he had paid for something, or what a building he owned was worth, or how much one of his casinos was earning when it was actually on its way to bankruptcy.” Trump bragged that he paid only eight million dollars for Mar-a-Lago, but omitted that he bought a nearby strip of beach for a record sum. After gossip columns reported, erroneously, that Prince Charles was considering buying several apartments in Trump Tower, Trump implied that he had no idea where the rumor had started. (“It certainly didn’t hurt us,” he says, in “The Art of the Deal.”) Wayne Barrett, a reporter for the _Village Voice_, later revealed that Trump himself had planted the story with journalists. Schwartz also suspected that Trump engaged in such media tricks, and asked him about a story making the rounds—that Trump often called up news outlets using a pseudonym. Trump didn’t deny it. As Schwartz recalls, he smirked and said, “You like that, do you?”\n\n\n\n\n\nSchwartz says of Trump, “He lied strategically. He had a complete lack of conscience about it.” Since most people are “constrained by the truth,” Trump’s indifference to it “gave him a strange advantage.”\n\n\n\nWhen challenged about the facts, Schwartz says, Trump would often double down, repeat himself, and grow belligerent. This quality was recently on display after Trump posted on Twitter a derogatory image of Hillary Clinton that contained a six-pointed star lifted from a white-supremacist Web site. Campaign staffers took the image down, but two days later Trump angrily defended it, insisting that there was no anti-Semitic implication. Whenever “the thin veneer of Trump’s vanity is challenged,” Schwartz says, he overreacts—not an ideal quality in a head of state. \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/593b672ef60db474ba953ccf]\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nWhen Schwartz began writing “The Art of the Deal,” he realized that he needed to put an acceptable face on Trump’s loose relationship with the truth. So he concocted an artful euphemism. Writing in Trump’s voice, he explained to the reader, “I play to people’s fantasies. . . . People want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular. I call it truthful hyperbole. It’s an innocent form of exaggeration—and it’s a very effective form of promotion.” Schwartz now disavows the passage. “Deceit,” he told me, is never “innocent.” He added, “ ‘Truthful hyperbole’ is a contradiction in terms. It’s a way of saying, ‘It’s a lie, but who cares?’ ” Trump, he said, loved the phrase.\n\n\n\nIn his journal, Schwartz describes the process of trying to make Trump’s voice palatable in the book. It was kind of “a trick,” he writes, to mimic Trump’s blunt, staccato, no-apologies delivery while making him seem almost boyishly appealing. One strategy was to make it appear that Trump was just having fun at the office. “I try not to take any of what’s happened too seriously,” Trump says in the book. “The real excitement is playing the game.”\n\n\n\nIn his journal, Schwartz wrote, “Trump stands for many of the things I abhor: his willingness to run over people, the gaudy, tacky, gigantic obsessions, the absolute lack of interest in anything beyond power and money.” Looking back at the text now, Schwartz says, “I created a character far more winning than Trump actually is.” The first line of the book is an example. “I don’t do it for the money,” Trump declares. “I’ve got enough, much more than I’ll ever need. I do it to do it. Deals are my art form. Other people paint beautifully on canvas or write wonderful poetry. I like making deals, preferably big deals. That’s how I get my kicks.” Schwartz now laughs at this depiction of Trump as a devoted artisan. “_Of course_ he’s in it for the money,” he said. “One of the most deep and basic needs he has is to prove that ‘I’m richer than you.’ ” As for the idea that making deals is a form of poetry, Schwartz says, “He was incapable of saying something like that—it wouldn’t even be in his vocabulary.” He saw Trump as driven not by a pure love of dealmaking but by an insatiable hunger for “money, praise, and celebrity.” Often, after spending the day with Trump, and watching him pile one hugely expensive project atop the next, like a circus performer spinning plates, Schwartz would go home and tell his wife, “He’s a living black hole!”\n\n\n\nSchwartz reminded himself that he was being paid to tell Trump’s story, not his own, but the more he worked on the project the more disturbing he found it. In his journal, he describes the hours he spent with Trump as “draining” and “deadening.” Schwartz told me that Trump’s need for attention is “completely compulsive,” and that his bid for the Presidency is part of a continuum. “He’s managed to keep increasing the dose for forty years,” Schwartz said. After he’d spent decades as a tabloid titan, “the only thing left was running for President. If he could run for emperor of the world, he would.”\n\n\n\nRhetorically, Schwartz’s aim in “The Art of the Deal” was to present Trump as the hero of every chapter, but, after looking into some of his supposedly brilliant deals, Schwartz concluded that there were cases in which there was no way to make Trump look good. So he sidestepped unflattering incidents and details. “I didn’t consider it my job to investigate,” he says.\n\n\n\nSchwartz also tried to avoid the strong whiff of cronyism that hovered over some deals. In his 1986 journal, he describes what a challenge it was to “put his best foot forward” in writing about one of Trump’s first triumphs: his development, starting in 1975, of the Grand Hyatt Hotel, on the site of the former Commodore Hotel, next to Grand Central Terminal. In order to afford the hotel, Trump required an extremely large tax abatement. Richard Ravitch, who was then in charge of the agency that had the authority to grant such tax breaks to developers, recalls that he declined to grant the abatement, and Trump got “so unpleasant I had to tell him to get out.” Trump got it anyway, largely because key city officials had received years of donations from his father, Fred Trump, who was a major real-estate developer in Queens. Wayne Barrett, whose reporting for the _Voice_ informed his definitive 1991 book, “Trump: The Deals and the Downfall,” says, “It was all Fred’s political connections that created the abatement.” In addition, Trump snookered rivals into believing that he had an exclusive option from the city on the project, when he didn’t. Trump also deceived his partner in the deal, Jay Pritzker, the head of the Hyatt Hotel chain. Pritzker had rejected an unfavorable term proposed by Trump, but at the closing Trump forced it through, knowing that Pritzker was on a mountain in Nepal and could not be reached. Schwartz wrote in his journal that “almost everything” about the hotel deal had “an immoral cast.” But as the ghostwriter he was “trying hard to find my way around” behavior that he considered “if not reprehensible, at least morally questionable.”\n\n\n\nMany tall tales that Trump told Schwartz contained a kernel of truth but made him out to be cleverer than he was. One of Trump’s favorite stories was about how he had tricked the company that owned Holiday Inn into becoming his partner in an Atlantic City casino. Trump claimed that he had quieted executives’ fears of construction delays by ordering his construction supervisor to make a vacant lot that he owned look like “the most active construction site in the history of the world.” As Trump tells it in “The Art of the Deal,” there were so many dump trucks and bulldozers pushing around dirt and filling holes that had just been dug that when Holiday Inn executives visited the site it “looked as if we were in the midst of building the Grand Coulee Dam.” The stunt, Trump claimed, pushed the deal through. After the book came out, though, a consultant for Trump’s casinos, Al Glasgow, who is now deceased, told Schwartz, “It never happened.” There may have been one or two trucks, but not the fleet that made it a great story.\n\n\n\nSchwartz tamped down some of Trump’s swagger, but plenty of it remained. The manuscript that Random House published was, depending on your perspective, either entertainingly insightful or shamelessly self-aggrandizing. To borrow a title from Norman Mailer, who frequently attended prizefights at Trump’s Atlantic City hotels, the book could have been called “Advertisements for Myself.”\n\n\n\nIn 2005, Timothy L. O’Brien, an award-winning journalist who is currently the executive editor of Bloomberg View, published “Trump Nation,” a meticulous investigative biography. (Trump unsuccessfully sued him for libel.) O’Brien has taken a close look at “The Art of the Deal,” and he told me that it might be best characterized as a “nonfiction work of fiction.” Trump’s life story, as told by Schwartz, honestly chronicled a few setbacks, such as Trump’s disastrous 1983 purchase of the New Jersey Generals, a football team in the flailing United States Football League. But O’Brien believes that Trump used the book to turn almost every step of his life, both personal and professional, into a “glittering fable.”\n\n\n\nSome of the falsehoods in “The Art of the Deal” are minor. _Spy_ upended Trump’s claims that Ivana had been a “top model” and an alternate on the Czech Olympic ski team. Barrett notes that in “The Art of the Deal” Trump describes his father as having been born in New Jersey to Swedish parents; in fact, he was born in the Bronx to German parents. (Decades later, Trump spread falsehoods about Obama’s origins, claiming it was possible that the President was born in Africa.)\n\n\n\nIn “The Art of the Deal,” Trump portrays himself as a warm family man with endless admirers. He praises Ivana’s taste and business skill—“I said you can’t bet against Ivana, and she proved me right.” But Schwartz noticed little warmth or communication between Trump and Ivana, and he later learned that while “The Art of the Deal” was being written Trump began an affair with Marla Maples, who became his second wife. (He divorced Ivana in 1992.) As far as Schwartz could tell, Trump spent very little time with his family and had no close friends. In “The Art of the Deal,” Trump describes Roy Cohn, his personal lawyer, in the warmest terms, calling him “the sort of guy who’d be there at your hospital bed . . . literally standing by you to the death.” Cohn, who in the fifties assisted Senator Joseph McCarthy in his vicious crusade against Communism, was closeted. He felt abandoned by Trump when he became fatally ill from *AIDS*{: .small}, and said, “Donald pisses ice water.” Schwartz says of Trump, “He’d like people when they were helpful, and turn on them when they weren’t. It wasn’t personal. He’s a transactional man—it was all about what you could do for him.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nAccording to Barrett, among the most misleading aspects of “The Art of the Deal” was the idea that Trump made it largely on his own, with only minimal help from his father, Fred. Barrett, in his book, notes that Trump once declared, “The working man likes me because he knows I didn’t inherit what I’ve built,” and that in “The Art of the Deal” he derides wealthy heirs as members of “the Lucky Sperm Club.”\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump’s self-portrayal as a Horatio Alger figure has buttressed his populist appeal in 2016. But his origins were hardly humble. Fred’s fortune, based on his ownership of middle-income properties, wasn’t glamorous, but it was sizable: in 2003, a few years after Fred died, Trump and his siblings reportedly sold some of their father’s real-estate holdings for half a billion dollars. In “The Art of the Deal,” Trump cites his father as “the most important influence on me,” but in his telling his father’s main legacy was teaching him the importance of “toughness.” Beyond that, Schwartz says, Trump “barely talked about his father—he didn’t want his success to be seen as having anything to do with him.” But when Barrett investigated he found that Trump’s father was instrumental in his son’s rise, financially and politically. In the book, Trump says that “my energy and my enthusiasm” explain how, as a twenty-nine-year-old with few accomplishments, he acquired the Grand Hyatt Hotel. Barrett reports, however, that Trump’s father had to co-sign the many contracts that the deal required. He also lent Trump seven and a half million dollars to get started as a casino owner in Atlantic City; at one point, when Trump couldn’t meet payments on other loans, his father tried to tide him over by sending a lawyer to buy some three million dollars’ worth of gambling chips. Barrett told me, “Donald did make some smart moves himself, particularly in assembling the site for the Trump Tower. That was a stroke of genius.” Nonetheless, he said, “The notion that he’s a self-made man is a joke. But I guess they couldn’t call the book ‘The Art of My Father’s Deals.’ ”\n\n\n\nThe other key myth perpetuated by “The Art of the Deal” was that Trump’s intuitions about business were almost flawless. “The book helped fuel the notion that he couldn’t fail,” Barrett said. But, unbeknown to Schwartz and the public, by late 1987, when the book came out, Trump was heading toward what Barrett calls “simultaneous personal and professional self-destruction.” O’Brien agrees that during the next several years Trump’s life unravelled. The divorce from Ivana reportedly cost him twenty-five million dollars. Meanwhile, he was in the midst of what O’Brien calls “a crazy shopping spree that resulted in unmanageable debt.” He was buying the Plaza Hotel and also planning to erect “the tallest building in the world,” on the former rail yards that he had bought on the West Side. In 1987, the city denied him permission to construct such a tall skyscraper, but in “The Art of the Deal” he brushed off this failure with a one-liner: “I can afford to wait.” O’Brien says, “The reality is that he _couldn’t_ afford to wait. He was telling the media that the carrying costs were three million dollars, when in fact they were more like twenty million.” Trump was also building a third casino in Atlantic City, the Taj, which he promised would be “the biggest casino in history.” He bought the Eastern Air Lines shuttle that operated out of New York, Boston, and Washington, rechristening it the Trump Shuttle, and acquired a giant yacht, the Trump Princess. “He was on a total run of complete and utter self-absorption,” Barrett says, adding, “It’s kind of like now.”\n\n\n\nSchwartz said that when he was writing the book “the greatest percentage of Trump’s assets was in casinos, and he made it sound like each casino was more successful than the last. But every one of them was failing.” He went on, “I think he was just spinning. I don’t think he could have believed it at the time. He was losing millions of dollars a day. He had to have been terrified.”\n\n\n\nIn 1992, the journalist David Cay Johnston published a book about casinos, “Temples of Chance,” and cited a net-worth statement from 1990 that assessed Trump’s personal wealth. It showed that Trump owed nearly three hundred million dollars more to his creditors than his assets were worth. The next year, his company was forced into bankruptcy—the first of six such instances. The Trump meteor had crashed.\n\n\n\nBut in “The Art of the Deal,” O’Brien told me, “Trump shrewdly and unabashedly promoted an image of himself as a dealmaker nonpareil who could always get the best out of every situation—and who can now deliver America from its malaise.” This idealized version was presented to an exponentially larger audience, O’Brien noted, when Mark Burnett, the reality-television producer, read “The Art of the Deal” and decided to base a new show on it, “The Apprentice,” with Trump as the star. The first season of the show, which premièred in 2004, opens with Trump in the back of a limousine, boasting, “I’ve mastered the art of the deal, and I’ve turned the name Trump into the highest-quality brand.” An image of the book’s cover flashes onscreen as Trump explains that, as the “master,” he is now seeking an apprentice. O’Brien said, “ ‘The Apprentice’ is mythmaking on steroids. There’s a straight line from the book to the show to the 2016 campaign.”\n\n\n\nIt took Schwartz a little more than a year to write “The Art of the Deal.” In the spring of 1987, he sent the manuscript to Trump, who returned it to him shortly afterward. There were a few red marks made with a fat-tipped Magic Marker, most of which deleted criticisms that Trump had made of powerful individuals he no longer wanted to offend, such as Lee Iacocca. Otherwise, Schwartz says, Trump changed almost nothing.\n\n\n\nIn my phone interview with Trump, he initially said of Schwartz, “Tony was very good. He was the co-author.” But he dismissed Schwartz’s account of the writing process. “He didn’t write the book,” Trump told me. “_I_ wrote the book. I wrote the book. It was my book. And it was a No. 1 best-seller, and one of the best-selling business books of all time. Some say it was the best-selling business book ever.” (It is not.) Howard Kaminsky, the former Random House head, laughed and said, “Trump didn’t write a postcard for us!”\n\n\n\nTrump was far more involved in the book’s promotion. He wooed booksellers and made one television appearance after another. He publicly promised to donate his cut of the book’s royalties to charity. He even made a surprise trip to New Hampshire, where he stirred additional publicity by floating the possibility that he might run for President.\n\n\n\nIn December of 1987, a month after the book was published, Trump hosted an extravagant book party in the pink marble atrium of Trump Tower. Klieg lights lit a red carpet outside the building. Inside, nearly a thousand guests, in black tie, were served champagne and fed slices of a giant cake replica of Trump Tower, which was wheeled in by a parade of women waving red sparklers. The boxing promoter Don King greeted the crowd in a floor-length mink coat, and the comedian Jackie Mason introduced Donald and Ivana with the words “Here comes the king and queen!” Trump toasted Schwartz, saying teasingly that he had at least tried to teach him how to make money.\n\n\n\nSchwartz got more of an education the next day, when he and Trump spoke on the phone. After chatting briefly about the party, Trump informed Schwartz that, as his ghostwriter, he owed him for half the event’s cost, which was in the six figures. Schwartz was dumbfounded. “He wanted me to split the cost of entertaining his list of nine hundred second-rate celebrities?” Schwartz had, in fact, learned a few things from watching Trump. He drastically negotiated down the amount that he agreed to pay, to a few thousand dollars, and then wrote Trump a letter promising to write a check not to Trump but to a charity of Schwartz’s choosing. It was a page out of Trump’s playbook. In the past seven years, Trump has promised to give millions of dollars to charity, but reporters for the Washington _Post_ found that they could document only ten thousand dollars in donations—and they uncovered no direct evidence that Trump made charitable contributions from money earned by “The Art of the Deal.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nNot long after the discussion of the party bills, Trump approached Schwartz about writing a sequel, for which Trump had been offered a seven-figure advance. This time, however, he offered Schwartz only a third of the profits. He pointed out that, because the advance was much bigger, the payout would be, too. But Schwartz said no. Feeling deeply alienated, he instead wrote a book called “What Really Matters,” about the search for meaning in life. After working with Trump, Schwartz writes, he felt a “gnawing emptiness” and became a “seeker,” longing to “be connected to something timeless and essential, more real.”\n\n\n\n\n\nSchwartz told me that he has decided to pledge all royalties from sales of “The Art of the Deal” in 2016 to pointedly chosen charities: the National Immigration Law Center, Human Rights Watch, the Center for the Victims of Torture, the National Immigration Forum, and the Tahirih Justice Center. He doesn’t feel that the gesture absolves him. “I’ll carry this until the end of my life,” he said. “There’s no righting it. But I like the idea that, the more copies that ‘The Art of the Deal’ sells, the more money I can donate to the people whose rights Trump seeks to abridge.”\n\n\n\nSchwartz expected Trump to attack him for speaking out, and he was correct. Informed that Schwartz had made critical remarks about him, and wouldn’t be voting for him, Trump said, “He’s probably just doing it for the publicity.” He also said, “Wow. That’s great disloyalty, because I made Tony rich. He owes a lot to me. I helped him when he didn’t have two cents in his pocket. It’s great disloyalty. I guess he thinks it’s good for him—but he’ll find out it’s not good for him.”\n\n\n\nMinutes after Trump got off the phone with me, Schwartz’s cell phone rang. “I hear you’re not voting for me,” Trump said. “I just talked to _The New Yorker_—which, by the way, is a failing magazine that no one reads—and I heard you were critical of me.”\n\n\n\n“You’re running for President,” Schwartz said. “I disagree with a lot of what you’re saying.”\n\n\n\n“That’s your right, but then you should have just remained silent. I just want to tell you that I think you’re very disloyal. Without me, you wouldn’t be where you are now. I had a lot of choice of who to have write the book, and I chose you, and I was very generous with you. I know that you gave a lot of speeches and lectures using ‘The Art of the Deal.’ I could have sued you, but I didn’t.”\n\n\n\n“My business has nothing to do with ‘The Art of the Deal.’ ”\n\n\n\n“That’s not what I’ve been told.”\n\n\n\n“You’re running for President of the United States. The stakes here are high.”\n\n\n\n“Yeah, they are,” he said. “Have a nice life.” Trump hung up.\n\n\n\nSchwartz can understand why Trump feels stung, but he felt that he had to speak up before it was too late. As for Trump’s anger toward him, he said, “I don’t take it personally, because the truth is he didn’t mean it personally. People are dispensable and disposable in Trump’s world.” If Trump is elected President, he warned, “the millions of people who voted for him and believe that he represents their interests will learn what anyone who deals closely with him already knows—that he couldn’t care less about them.” ♦","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/donald-trumps-ghostwriter-tells-all","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1d44b75f002c8941e543","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Autobiographies","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"autobiographies"},{"id":"5c2e1c7622d4972cd5b83286","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books"},{"id":"5c2e1cbc4a08312cd3aa6c9a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Campaigns","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"campaigns"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1fc97e716b454591b038","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Ghostwriters","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"ghostwriters"},{"id":"5c2e1d68397f5b30646d06f7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Lies","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"lies"},{"id":"5c2e1ee12bc86f2c9a244bde","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Lying","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"lying"},{"id":"5c2e1c792bc86f2c9a244998","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Memoirs","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"memoirs"},{"id":"5c2e1c7636cecf40192141bf","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"New York","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"new-york"},{"id":"5c2e1c8a41c92e2c9b85da3d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"},{"id":"5c2e1c7736cecf40192141c2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Presidential Candidates","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"presidential-candidates"},{"id":"5c2e1d322bc86f2c9a244a5b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tweets","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tweets"}],"sections":[{"id":"5910ee07dd6207318b5de389","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"The Political Scene","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"the-political-scene"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590c95a2da97f12ef915ff79","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"\nJane Mayer has been a staff writer at *The New Yorker* since 1995.

The House had impeached Chase, a Marylander, on seven articles of misconduct and one article of rudeness. Burr had been indicted in New Jersey, where, according to the indictment, “not having the fear of God before his eyes but being moved and seduced by the instigation of the Devil,” he’d killed Alexander Hamilton, the former Secretary of the Treasury, in a duel. Because Hamilton, who was shot in the belly, died in New York, Burr had been indicted there, too. Still, the Senate met in Washington, and, until Burr’s term expired, he held the title of Vice-President of the United States.\n\nThe public loves an impeachment, until the public hates an impeachment. For the occasion of Chase’s impeachment trial, a special gallery for lady spectators had been built at the back of the Senate chamber. Burr, a Republican, presided over a Senate of twenty-five Republicans and nine Federalists, who sat, to either side of him, on two rows of crimson cloth-covered benches. They faced three rows of green cloth-covered benches occupied by members of the House of Representatives, Supreme Court Justices, and President Thomas Jefferson’s Cabinet. The House managers (the impeachment-trial equivalent of prosecutors), led by the Virginian John Randolph, sat at a table covered with blue cloth; at another blue table sat Chase and his lawyers, led by the red-faced Maryland attorney general, Luther Martin, a man so steady of heart and clear of mind that in 1787 he’d walked out of the Constitutional Convention, and refused to sign the Constitution, after objecting that its countenancing of slavery was “inconsistent with the principles of the Revolution and dishonorable to the American character.” Luther (Brandybottle) Martin had a weakness for liquor. This did not impair him. As a wise historian once remarked, Martin “knew more law drunk than the managers did sober.”\n\n[Impeachment](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/impeachment) is an ancient relic, a rusty legal instrument and political weapon first wielded by the English Parliament, in 1376, to wrest power from the King by charging his ministers with abuses of power, convicting them, removing them from office, and throwing them in prison. Some four hundred years later, impeachment had all but vanished from English practice when American delegates to the Constitutional Convention provided for it in Article II, Section 4: “The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.”\n\nIt’s one thing to know this power exists. It’s another to use it. In one view, nicely expressed by an English solicitor general in 1691, “The power of impeachment ought to be, like Goliath’s sword, kept in the temple, and not used but on great occasions.” Yet this autumn, in the third year of the Presidency of Donald J. Trump, House Democrats have unsheathed that terrible, mighty sword. Has time dulled its blade?\n\n-=-=-=\n\nImpeachment is a terrible power because it was forged to counter a terrible power: the despot who deems himself to be above the law. The delegates to the Constitutional Convention included impeachment in the Constitution as a consequence of their knowledge of history, a study they believed to be a prerequisite for holding a position in government. From their study of English history, they learned what might be called the law of knavery: there aren’t any good ways to get rid of a bad king. Really, there were only three ways and they were all horrible: civil war, revolution, or assassination. England had already endured the first and America the second, and no one could endorse the third. “What was the practice before this in cases where the chief Magistrate rendered himself obnoxious?” Benjamin Franklin asked at the Convention. “Recourse was had to assassination, in which he was not only deprived of his life but of the opportunity of vindicating his character.”\n\nBut the delegates knew that Parliament had come up with another way: clipping the King’s wings by impeaching his ministers. The House of Commons couldn’t attack the King directly because of the fiction that the King was infallible (“perfect,” as Donald Trump would say), so, beginning in 1376, they impeached his favorites, accusing Lord William Latimer and Richard Lyons of acting “falsely in order to have advantages for their own use.” Latimer, a peer, insisted that he be tried by his peers—that is, by the House of Lords, not the House of Commons—and it was his peers who convicted him and sent him to prison. That’s why, today, the House is preparing articles of impeachment against Trump, acting as his accusers, but it is the Senate that will judge his innocence or his guilt.\n\nParliament used impeachment to thwart monarchy’s tendency toward absolutism, with mixed results. After conducting at least ten impeachments between 1376 and 1450, Parliament didn’t impeach anyone for more than a hundred and seventy years, partly because Parliament met only when the King summoned it, and, if Parliament was going to impeach his ministers, he’d show them by never summoning it, unless he really had to, as when he needed to levy taxes. He, or she: during the forty-five years of Elizabeth I’s reign, Parliament was in session for a total of three. Parliament had forged a sword. It just couldn’t ever get into Westminster to take it out of its sheath.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/5da7b8fc542ea10008347192]||||||\n+++\n\nThe Englishman responsible for bringing the ancient practice of impeachment back into use was Edward Coke, an investor in the Virginia Company who became a Member of Parliament in 1589\\. Coke, a profoundly agile legal thinker, had served as Elizabeth I’s Attorney General and as Chief Justice under her successor, James I. In 1621—two years after the first Africans, slaves, landed in the Virginia colony and a year after the Pilgrims, dissenters, landed at a place they called Plymouth—Coke began to insist that Parliament could debate whatever it wanted to, and soon Parliament began arguing that it ought to meet regularly. To build a case for the supremacy of Parliament, Coke dug out of the archives a very old document, the Magna Carta of 1215, calling it England’s “ancient constitution,” and he resurrected, too, the ancient right of Parliament to impeach the King’s ministers. Parliament promptly impeached Coke’s chief adversary, Francis Bacon, the Lord Chancellor, for bribery; Bacon was convicted, removed from office, and reduced to penury. James then dissolved Parliament and locked up Coke in the Tower of London.\n\nSomething of a political death match followed between Parliament and James and his Stuart successors Charles I and Charles II, over the nature of rule. In 1626, the House of Commons impeached the Duke of Buckingham for “maladministration” and corruption, including failure to safeguard the seas. But the King, James’s son, Charles I, forestalled a trial in the House of Lords by dismissing Parliament. After Buckingham died, Charles refused to summon Parliament for the next eleven years. In 1649, he was beheaded for treason. After the restoration of the monarchy, in 1660, under Charles II, Parliament occasionally impeached the King’s ministers, but in 1716 stopped doing so altogether. Because Parliament had won. It had made the King into a flightless bird.\n\nWhy the Americans should have resurrected this practice in 1787 is something of a puzzle, until you remember that all but one of England’s original thirteen American colonies had been founded before impeachment went out of style. Also, while Parliament had gained power relative to the King, the Colonial assemblies remained virtually powerless, especially against the authority of Colonial governors, who, in most colonies, were appointed by the King. To clip their governors’ wings, Colonial assemblies impeached the governors’ men, only to find their convictions overturned by the Privy Council in London, which acted as an appellate court. Colonial lawyers pursuing these cases dedicated themselves to the study of the impeachments against the three Stuart kings. John Adams owned a copy of a law book that defined “impeachment” as “the Accusation and Prosecution of a Person for Treason, or other Crimes and Misdemeanors.” Steeped in the lore of Parliament’s seventeenth-century battles with the Stuarts, men like Adams considered the right of impeachment to be one of the fundamental rights of Englishmen. And when men like Adams came to write constitutions for the new states, in the seventeen-seventies and eighties, they made sure that impeachment was provided for. In Philadelphia in 1787, thirty-three of the Convention’s fifty-five delegates were trained as lawyers; ten were or had been judges. As Frank Bowman, a law professor at the University of Missouri, reports in a new book, “[High Crimes and Misdemeanors: A History of Impeachment for the Age of Trump](https://www.amazon.com/High-Crimes-Misdemeanors-History-Impeachment/dp/1108481051),” fourteen of the delegates had helped draft constitutions in their own states that provided for impeachment. In Philadelphia, they forged a new sword out of very old steel. They Americanized impeachment.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nThis new government would have a President, not a king, but Americans agreed on the need for a provision to get rid of a bad one. All four of the original plans for a new constitution allowed for Presidential impeachment. When the Constitutional Convention began, on May 25, 1787, impeachment appears to have been on nearly everyone’s mind, not least because Parliament had opened its first impeachment investigation in more than fifty years, on April 3rd, against a Colonial governor of India, and the member charged with heading the investigation was England’s famed supporter of American independence, Edmund Burke. What with one thing and another, impeachment came up in the Convention’s very first week.\n\nA President is not a king; his power would be checked by submitting himself to an election every four years, and by the separation of powers. But this did not provide “sufficient security,” James Madison said. “He might pervert his administration into a scheme of peculation or oppression. He might betray his trust to foreign powers.” Also, voters might make a bad decision, and regret it, well in advance of the next election. “Some mode of displacing an unfit magistrate is rendered indispensable by the fallibility of those who choose, as well as by the corruptibility of the man chosen,” the Virginia delegate George Mason said.\n\nHow impeachment actually worked would be hammered out through cases like the impeachment of Samuel Chase, a Supreme Court Justice, but, at the Constitutional Convention, nearly all discussion of impeachment concerned the Presidency. (“Vice President and all civil Officers” was added only at the very last minute.) A nation that had cast off a king refused to anoint another. “No point is of more importance than that the right of impeachment should continue,” Mason said. “Shall any man be above Justice? Above all shall that man be above it, who can commit the most extensive injustice?”\n\nMost of the discussion involved the nature of the conduct for which a President could be impeached. Early on, the delegates had listed, as impeachable offenses, “mal-practice or neglect of duty,” a list that got longer before a committee narrowed it down to “Treason & bribery.” When Mason proposed adding “maladministration,” Madison objected, on the ground that maladministration could mean just about anything. And, as the Pennsylvania delegate Gouverneur Morris put it, it would not be unreasonable to suppose that “an election of every four years will prevent maladministration.” Mason therefore proposed substituting “other high crimes and misdemeanors against the State.”\n\nThe “high” in “high crimes and misdemeanors” has its origins in phrases that include the “certain high treasons and offenses and misprisons” invoked in the impeachment of the Duke of Suffolk, in 1450\\. Parliament was the “high court,” the men Parliament impeached were of the “highest rank”; offenses that Parliament described as “high” were public offenses with consequences for the nation. The phrase “high crimes and misdemeanors” first appeared in an impeachment in 1642, and then regularly, as a catchall for all manner of egregious wrongs, abuses of authority, and crimes against the state.\n\nIn 1787, the delegates in Philadelphia narrowed their list down to “Treason & bribery, or other high crimes & misdemeanors against the United States.” In preparing the final draft of the Constitution, the Committee on Style deleted the phrase “against the United States,” presumably because it is implied.\n\n“What, then, is an impeachable offense?” Gerald Ford, the Michigan Republican and House Minority Leader, asked in 1970\\. “The only honest answer is that an impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history.” That wasn’t an honest answer; it was a depressingly cynical one. Ford had moved to impeach Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, accusing him of embracing a “hippie-yippie-style revolution,” indicting him for a decadent life style, and alleging financial improprieties, charges that appeared, to Ford’s critics, to fall well short of impeachable offenses. In 2017, Nancy Pelosi claimed that a President cannot be impeached who has not committed a crime (a position she would not likely take today). According to “[Impeachment: A Citizen’s Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Impeachment-Citizens-Cass-R-Sunstein/dp/0143135171),” by the legal scholar Cass Sunstein, who testified before Congress on the meaning of “high crimes and misdemeanors” during the impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton, both Ford and Pelosi were fundamentally wrong. “High crimes and misdemeanors” does have a meaning. An impeachable offense is an abuse of the power of the office that violates the public trust, runs counter to the national interest, and undermines the Republic. To believe that words are meaningless is to give up on truth. To believe that Presidents can do anything they like is to give up on self-government.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nThe U.S. Senate has held only eighteen impeachment trials in two hundred and thirty years, and only twice for a President. Because impeachment happens so infrequently, it’s hard to draw conclusions about what it does, or even how it works, and, on each occasion, people spend a lot of time fighting over the meaning of the words and the nature of the crimes. Every impeachment is a political experiment.\n\nThe ordeal of Samuel Chase is arguably the most significant but least studied impeachment in American history. The Chase impeachment was only the third ever attempted. In 1797, the House had impeached the Tennessee senator William Blount, who stood accused of scheming to conspire with the British and to enlist the Creek and Cherokee Nations to attack the Spanish, all with the design of increasing the value of his highly speculative purchase of Western lands. (“Whether the scheme was merely audacious or just plain crazy remains debatable,” Bowman writes, darkly foreshadowing more recent shenanigans, involving the possible acquisition of Greenland.) The case rested on a letter allegedly written by Blount, describing this plan; after two senators said they recognized Blount’s handwriting, the Senate expelled him in a vote of 25–1, and he slinked off to Tennessee. The House had voted to impeach, but Blount’s lawyers argued that senators are not “civil officers,” and so can’t be impeached. (“*#IMPEACHMITTROMNEY,*{: .small}” Trump tweeted recently. The Blount precedent went some way toward establishing that this is an impossibility.) The motion to dismiss was read aloud in the Senate by Jefferson, who was Vice-President at the time.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/5da7b8fc542ea10008347191]||||||\n+++\n\nSamuel Chase’s troubles began when Congress passed the 1798 Sedition Act, aimed at suppressing Republican opposition to John Adams’s Federalist Administration. Chase, riding circuit (which Supreme Court Justices used to do), had presided over the most notorious persecutions of Republican printers on charges of sedition, including the conviction of the printer James Callender. The Sedition Act expired on March 3, 1801, the day before Jefferson’s Inauguration, but, through a series of midnight appointments, Adams had connived to insure that Jefferson inherited a Federalist Supreme Court. Chase had actively campaigned for Adams and spoke intemperately for the bench, denouncing Republicans. In an overheated charge to a grand jury in Baltimore, he attacked Republicanism, describing it as “mobocracy.” Jefferson set an impeachment in motion when he wrote to House Republicans, “Ought this sedition and official attack on the principles of our Constitution . . . go unpunished?”\n\nIf the proceedings against Blount tested whether senators could be impeached, the proceedings against Chase tested a new theory of executive power—that Supreme Court Justices serve at the pleasure of the President. This test came in the wake of Marbury v. Madison, in 1803, in which John Marshall’s Supreme Court exercised a prerogative not specified in the Constitution: the Court had declared an act of Congress unconstitutional. A Republican leader of the Senate told the Massachusetts senator John Quincy Adams that he hoped to impeach the entire court. Judicial independence? Judicial review? No. “If the Judges of the Supreme Court should dare, *AS THEY HAD DONE*{: .small}, to declare an act of Congress unconstitutional . . . it was the undoubted right of the House of Representatives to remove them, for giving such opinions,” he said. “A removal by impeachment was nothing more than a declaration by Congress to this effect: You hold dangerous opinions, and if you are suffered to carry them into effect you will work the destruction of the nation.”\n\nJohn Randolph, a steadfast Republican but no lawyer, drafted the articles of impeachment against Chase, which broadly charged him with prostituting his high office to the low purpose of partisanship but, narrowly, rested on all manner of pettiness, including the charge that during Callender’s trial Chase had used “unusual, rude, and contemptuous expressions toward the prisoner’s counsel” and had engaged in “repeated and vexatious interruptions.” Notwithstanding the weakness of the charges, not to say their vexatiousness, the House voted to impeach. The trial in the Senate opened on February 4, 1805.\n\nAn impeachment trial is a medieval play, with its mummers and its costumes and its many-colored cloth-covered tables. Chase’s trial lasted a month. Burr ran a well-ordered court. He warned the senators not to eat apples and cake while in session. He censured them for leaving their seats. He hushed the spectators in the galleries.\n\nThe trial turned less on what Chase had done than on whether he could be impeached for having done those things. John Randolph, though, didn’t really have a theory of impeachment. He had a theory of vengeance. His arguments, a distressed John Quincy Adams wrote in his diary, consisted “altogether of the most hackneyed commonplaces of popular declamation, mingled up with panegyrics and invectives.” Randolph called eighteen witnesses, few of whom aided his case, and some of whom aided Chase’s. “Saw nothing that struck me as remarkable,” one witness, who had attended Callender’s trial, said. As an observer put it, “I swear if they go on much farther, they will prove Judge Chase an angel.”\n\nChase’s defense called thirty-one witnesses, including some of Randolph’s. Chase’s attorneys said the charges were plainly silly, and they didn’t much bother to refute them, especially since Randolph had done that job so well himself. Instead, they argued about the nature of impeachment. One of Chase’s younger lawyers, Joseph Hopkinson, insisted that “no judge can be impeached and removed from office for any act or offense for which he could not be indicted.” In other words, an impeachable offense has to be an indictable offense: a crime. “High crimes and misdemeanors,” Hopkinson argued, meant “high crimes” and “high misdemeanors.”\n\nThe trial reached its climax on February 23rd, when a red-faced Luther Martin rose from behind the defense’s table. He spoke for a day and a half, expounding on his own theory of impeachment. A judge could commit a crime, like hitting someone, for which he could not be impeached. He could even commit a high crime for which he could not be impeached. All that he could be impeached for were crimes “such as relate to his office, or which tend to cover the person, who committed them, with _turpitude_ and _infamy_; such as show there can be no dependence on that integrity and honor which will secure the performance of his official duties.” To be impeached, Martin said, a judge had to commit crimes that either derived from his judicial power or were so horrible, so grotesquely unethical, that they disqualified him from holding a position of public trust.\n\nRepublicans outnumbered Federalists in the Senate 25–9\\. On March 1st, for each article, Burr asked of each senator, “Is Samuel Chase, Esq., guilty or not guilty of a high crime or misdemeanor in the article of impeachment just read?” A majority voted guilty for three articles. None earned the required two-thirds super-majority. Six Republicans broke ranks on all eight articles. By a vote of 19–15, the Senate came closest to convicting Chase on the article regarding his partisan zeal in his charge to the Baltimore grand jury. Burr stood up. “It becomes my duty to pronounce that Samuel Chase, Esq., is acquitted,” he said. Then he bowed to Chase and left the chamber. As for Burr, he was never convicted of killing Alexander Hamilton. (Two years later, in an unrelated incident of amazing sneakiness, he was tried for treason, and acquitted.)\n\nThe acquittal of Samuel Chase established the independence of the judiciary. It also established another principle, as Bowman argues: “The price of the independence granted by life tenure is abstention from party politics.” It did not, however, establish a lasting theory of impeachment. Brandybottle Martin had stated his case beautifully, and easily defeated the hapless John Randolph, but Martin’s argument was wrong. Nothing in American history, from the founding of its earliest colonies, suggests that an impeachable offense has to be an indictable crime, not for the King’s men, not for judges and Justices, and not for the President of the United States. Presidents can be impeached for actions that are not crimes, not least because the criminal code was not written with Presidents in mind. Most of us cannot commit such staggering outrages as to direct the F.B.I. to spy on our enemies or enlist foreign powers to interfere in our elections. The President has powers that only a President can exercise, or abuse. Were these powers beyond the reach of the people’s power, impeachment would be a dead letter.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIf the House votes to impeach Donald Trump, it is by no means clear that the Senate will hold a trial. And, if the Senate does hold a trial, the likelihood that it will convict is small. Impeachment is a tall and rickety ladder; conviction is a tiny window, barely cracked open. It’s difficult and dangerous to climb the ladder, and no one who has made it to the top has ever managed to crawl in through the window.\n\nAfter the acquittal of Samuel Chase, in 1805, the House, in the next decades, impeached two more judges, one in 1830 and one in 1862; the Senate acquitted the first and convicted the second. The first real attempt to impeach a President came in 1843, when a Virginia congressman accused John Tyler of “corruption, malconduct, high crimes and misdemeanors,” but the House voted down a motion to investigate, 127–83.\n\nIn 1868, “out of the midst of political gloom, impeachment, that dead corpse, rose up and walked forth again!” Mark Twain wrote. Republicans in the House impeached President Andrew Johnson by a vote of 126–47\\. They were desperate, as Brenda Wineapple chronicles in her gripping new book, “[The Impeachers: The Trial of Andrew Johnson and the Dream of a Just Nation](https://www.amazon.com/Impeachers-Trial-Andrew-Johnson-Nation/dp/0812998367).” Johnson, a Tennessee Democrat who didn’t free his slaves until 1863, after the Emancipation Proclamation, had been Abraham Lincoln’s improbable Vice-President, and had assumed the office of the Presidency after his assassination, in 1865\\. Lincoln and congressional Republicans had one plan for Reconstruction: it involved welcoming the freedmen into the political community of the nation. Johnson, who believed that, “in the progress of nations, negroes have shown less capacity for government than any other race of people,” betrayed that vision. “Slavery is not abolished until the black man has the ballot,” Frederick Douglass declared. But granting the franchise to black men was the last thing Johnson intended to allow. While Congress was out of session, he set in motion a Reconstruction plan that was completely at variance with what Congress had proposed: he intended to return power to the very people who had waged war against the Union, and he readmitted the former Confederate states to the Union. “No power but Congress had any right to say whether ever or when they should be admitted to the Union as States and entitled to the privileges of the Constitution,” the Pennsylvania representative Thaddeus Stevens said during Johnson’s impeachment proceedings. (Stevens, ailing, had to be carried into the Capitol on a chair.) “And yet Andrew Johnson, with unblushing hardihood, undertook to rule them by his own power alone.” Johnson vetoed the 1866 Civil Rights Bill and nearly every other congressional attempt to reassert authority over the law of the United States. But the Republicans’ strategy, to pass a law they expected Johnson to break, so that they could impeach him, backfired.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/5da7b8fcf4a0610009e45e31]||||||\n+++\n\nThe Senate acquitted Johnson, falling short by a single vote of the two-thirds majority necessary to convict. Stevens died a couple of months later, “the bravest old ironclad in the Capitol,” Twain wrote. The Republicans had tried to save the Republic by burying the Confederacy for good. They failed.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nEvery impeachment reinvents what impeachment is for, and what it means, a theory of government itself. Every impeachment also offers a chance to establish a new political settlement in an unruly nation. The impeachment of Samuel Chase steered the United States toward judicial independence, and an accommodation with a party system that had not been anticipated by the Framers. Chase’s acquittal stabilized the Republic and restored the balance of power between the executive and the judicial branches. The failed impeachment of Andrew Johnson steered the United States toward a regime of racial segregation: the era of Jim Crow, which would not be undone until the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Acts of 1965 were passed, a century later, in the Administration of another Johnson. Johnson’s acquittal undid the Union’s victory in the Civil War, allowed the Confederacy to win the peace, and nearly destroyed the Republic.\n\nJohnson’s acquittal also elevated the Presidency by making impeachment seem doomed. Jefferson once lamented that impeachment had become a “mere scarecrow.” That’s how it worked for much of the twentieth century: propped up in a field, straw poking out from under its hat. A Republican congressman from Michigan called for the impeachment of F.D.R., after the President tried to pack the Court. Nothing but another scarecrow.\n\nThe impeachment of [Richard Nixon](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/richard-nixon), in 1974, which, although it never went to trial, succeeded in the sense that it drove Nixon from office, represented a use entirely consistent with the instrument’s medieval origins: it attempted to puncture the swollen power of the Presidency and to reassert the supremacy of the legislature. Nixon’s Presidency began to unravel only after the publication of the Pentagon Papers, in 1971—which indicted not Nixon but Lyndon Johnson, for deceiving the public about Vietnam—and the public anger that made impeachment possible had to do not only with Nixon’s lies and abuses of power but also with Johnson’s. But a new settlement, curtailing the powers of the President, never came. Instead, the nation became divided, and those divisions widened.\n\nThe wider those divisions, the duller the blade of impeachment. Only very rarely in American history has one party held more than two-thirds of the seats in the Senate (it hasn’t happened since 1967), and the more partisan American politics the less likely it is that sixty-seven senators can be rounded up to convict anyone, of anything. And yet the wider those divisions the more willing Congress has been to call for impeachment. Since Ronald Reagan’s Inauguration in 1981, members of the House have introduced resolutions for impeachment during every Presidency. And the people, too, have clamored. “Impeach Bush,” the yard signs read. “Impeach Obama.”\n\nNot every impeachment brings about a political settlement, good or bad. The failed impeachment of Bill Clinton, in 1999, for lying about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky, settled less than nothing, except that it weakened Americans’ faith in impeachment as anything other than a crudely wrought partisan hatchet, a prisoner’s shiv.\n\nClinton’s impeachment had one more consequence: it got Donald Trump, self-professed playboy, onto national television, as an authority on the sex lives of ego-mad men. “Paula Jones is a loser,” Trump said on CNBC. “It’s a terrible embarrassment.” Also, “I think his lawyers . . . did a terrible job,” Trump said. “I’m not even sure that he shouldn’t have just gone in and taken the Fifth Amendment.” Because why, after all, should any man have to answer for anything?\n\n“Heaven forbid we should see another impeachment!” an exhausted Republican said at the end of the trial of Samuel Chase. The impeachment of an American President is certain to lead to no end of political mischief and almost certain to fail. Still, worse could happen. Heaven forbid this Republic should become one man’s kingdom. ♦","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1d7041c92e2c9b85db21","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Impeachment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"impeachment"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1c997e716b454591add2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Presidents","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"presidents"},{"id":"5c2e6270a23f7a2cc1a7cb9d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books"},{"id":"5c2e1c9b2bc86f2c9a2449de","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"American History","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"american-history"}],"sections":[{"id":"591baef1349d4f46aa0520ac","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"American Chronicles","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"american-chronicles"}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5909ffbc1c7a8e33fb390bc3","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Jill Lepore, a staff writer, has been contributing to *The New Yorker* since 2005.

It contains a dedication, three epigraphs, an overture (declaring the author’s suspicion of paratext), a prologue, and another epigraph. Paging through this front matter feels like waiting for a haunted carnival ride to start, only to be wrong-footed. *When does it begin?* you think. Then you realize, *It’s already begun.* \n\nThe memoir, by the acclaimed author of the short-story collection “[Her Body and Other Parties](https://www.amazon.com/Her-Body-Other-Parties-Stories/dp/155597788X)”—which was a finalist, in 2017, for the National Book Award—chronicles Machado’s experience in a horrifying relationship. Just as it is difficult to say when the book begins, it is difficult to say when Machado’s girlfriend, blonde and slight, also a writer, first reveals her nature. Is it when she flies into a rage after Machado fails to respond immediately to a text? When she digs her fingers into Machado’s arm? Over the course of a formative love affair, the woman—who dwells, witchlike, in a cabin, in Bloomington, Indiana, which Machado calls the “Dream House”—will accuse Machado of cheating; throw things at her; lie to her; manipulate her; scream at her; and reduce her, again and again, to tears. \n\nYet the arc of this ordeal, although it forms the book’s skeleton, is not Machado’s true subject. Instead, “In the Dream House” is primarily about the quandary of constructing “In the Dream House.” It is a quandary both because the telling is painful and because Machado, who has no language for this telling, must invent one. The concept of “archival silence,” Machado writes, captures the idea that certain histories never enter the cultural record. Before she met her ex-girlfriend, Machado hadn’t encountered narratives of queer domestic abuse; she lacked context and precedents; she could not make sense of her experience. (In one passage, she compares her state of mind to that of a gay teen crushing on a same-sex classmate without knowing anything about gayness.) In the book’s opening pages, Machado notes that the word “archive” derives from the ancient Greek word for “house.” She invokes Louise Bourgeois’s theorization of memory as “a form of architecture.” Her intent becomes clear: to imagine an archive, or dream a structure, in which her story can live, surrounded by literary trappings—epigraphs, prologue—that lend it legitimacy. Machado’s introductory quotes aren’t just gloss, in other words. They’re bricks. \n\nThe book itself takes a breathtakingly inventive form. Each short chapter examines its content through a lens—or places it in a room—that is summarized by a heading: “*Dream House as* Confession,” “*Dream House* *as* Stoner Comedy,” “*Dream House* *as* Word Problem.” The relationship between section and title morphs throughout. Some chapters sample the tropes and tones of their professed genre. (“*Dream House* *as* Noir,” which unpacks the sexist stereotype of the stormy lesbian romance, concludes “Dames, right?”) Other chapters seem to critique their classification or to be only glancingly connected to it. This elaborate architecture could have felt florid, but the headings also help unlock each vignette’s function, like a brushstroke guiding viewers’ eyes around a painting. “*Dream House* *as* Déjà Vu” conjures the eeriness of a relationship’s private, repeated mantras. In “*Traumhaus* *as* Lipogram,” Machado compares writing under a formal constraint—without the letter *e*—to absorbing the “taints” of abuse. One is confined in ways that are not immediately legible; there’s a whisper of wrongness. (“It is an awful thing, that missing symbol,” Machado writes. “Folks *know*.”) These shifting angles of illumination achieve a full, strange representation of the subject. Machado acknowledges that we are more than what happens to us; we are also the scripts we use to imagine ourselves. \n\nThe book feels ambitious in other ways. Along with chronological vignettes from her relationship, Machado weaves in childhood memories, meditations on queer representation, and a legal history of lesbian domestic abuse. The text can inhabit any skin, but it cannot reverse time or save the writer’s past self. The point of view cycles between an “I” that speaks for Machado-the-author, fierce and eloquent, and a “you” that signifies Machado-the-victim. The disconnect between these perspectives accounts for the memoir’s air of anxious virtuosity. “I left, and then lived: moved to the East Coast&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. moved in with a beautiful woman,” Machado writes. “You cried in front of many people. You missed readings, parties, the supermoon.” Sometimes, the two personae flicker and merge. One chapter, “*Dream House* *as* Accident,” both recounts an accident and feels, artistically, like an accident: a one-sentence interlude that violates the memoir’s logic. An accident is not a type of story—or is it? It is as if the book is both unravelling and teaching readers how to read it. \n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nMachado’s writing, with its heat and precise command of tone, has always had a sentient quality. But what makes “In the Dream House” a particularly self-aware structure—which is to say, a true haunted house—is the intimation that it is critiquing itself in real time. Machado seems to anticipate—and even riff on—our skepticism of her tricks. “*Dream House* *as* Pop Single,” which examines the Aimee Mann ballad “Voices Carry,” is a suggestive but perhaps unnecessary study of how song lyrics might depict domestic abuse. It feels digressive, but intentionally so, and in the next chapter, “*Dream House* *as* Half Credit,” Machado cops to scribbling in as much information about a topic as she can when the answer on a test eludes her. Later, she addresses directly her tendency to fracture narratives: “You know that if you break them and reposition them and unravel them and remove their gears you will be able to access their truths in a way you couldn’t before.” Given the truths that do emerge, it’s a convincing explanation for her methods—if also, apparently, a self-serving one. “I broke the stories down,” Machado writes, “because I was breaking down and didn’t know what else to do.”\n\nSome of Machado’s preëmptive maneuvers work better than others. “*Dream House* *as* Queer Villainy” celebrates the “aesthetic lushness and theatrical glee” of figures like Cruella de Vil, Ursula, and Jafar. Machado appears to be wrestling with the imagined objection that her book participates in a tradition of demonizing gay characters. Her answer—that queer people “deserve to have our wrongdoing represented as much as our heroism, because when we refuse wrongdoing as a possibility for a group of people, we refuse their humanity”—feels a bit like Intro to the Politics of Representation. Another chapter, “*Dream House* *as* Unreliable Narrator,” walks a similar line between basic and resonant. “My parents&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. loved to refer to me as ‘melodramatic,’ or, worse, ‘a drama queen,’ ” Machado writes. She fumed to see her poetic outrage at the world’s injustice reduced to a plea for attention. “After all,” she notes, “melodrama comes from *melos*, which means ‘music,’ ‘honey’; a drama queen is, nonetheless, a queen.” Machado understands that memoir, like architecture, requires a sense of proportion. The problem is that women’s feelings are rarely ever considered proportional. \n\nMachado is taking huge formal risks; she’d be unreadable were she not also disciplining her book to within an inch of its life. Consider the Dream House’s many personalities: “a convent of promise (herb garden, wine, writing across the table from each other), a den of debauchery (fucking with the windows open, waking up with mouth on mouth, the low, insistent murmur of fantasy), a haunted house (*none of this can really be happening*), a prison (*need to get out need to get out)*, and, finally, a dungeon of memory.” The place’s meanings proliferate wildly—an effect of trauma—but the writer remains in control. Her images resist dissection. “In dreams,” Machado continues, the house “sits behind a green door, for reasons you have never understood. The door was not green.” \n\nI love that green door for the way that it flashes up from Machado’s unconscious, signifying—what? Poison? Regeneration? She is describing how a place seeps, with alterations, into her nightmares, and yet much of the book does the reverse: it shows phantasmagoria overtaking a physical site. Here and in her short stories, Machado subjects the contemporary world to the logic of dreaming. She is often said to spin urban legends or fairy tales; her writing, while clear, is full of nameless currents, hidden transactions between pleasure and terror. The result is a space that cannot, even years later, be easily escaped. “It occurs to you,” Machado writes, “that you are this house’s ghost.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1ecb41c92e2c9b85dc16","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1ecb41c92e2c9b85dc16","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Domestic

meets many of the prerequisites conjured by the phrase “collection of essays by Leslie Jamison.” It explores notions of witness, storytelling, and authenticity; of art and morality; and of pain—others’ and one’s own. Stylistically, the book is almost frustratingly eloquent. Jamison, who has also authored an addiction memoir, “[The Recovering](https://www.amazon.com/Recovering-Intoxication-Its-Aftermath/dp/0316259616),” can pin an idea with the speed and fluidity of a pro athlete. (A stepmother becomes “a token mascot of the dark maternal.”) She thinks ethically but feels aesthetically. Her writing, although lyrical, proceeds with a precise, searching sobriety—each sentence a controlled swoon. \n\nA question raised by these new essays is whether they advance the work done by “[The Empathy Exams](https://www.amazon.com/Empathy-Exams-Essays-Leslie-Jamison/dp/1555976719),” Jamison’s breakthrough book. One feat of that volume, from 2014, was to establish an analogy between the mechanics of empathy and those of metaphor. Empathy—feeling with or as someone else—projects the self onto another, and metaphor projects meaning onto the world. In pieces on ultramarathoners and poverty tourists and people suffering from mysterious (and perhaps psychosomatic) illnesses, Jamison defended the creative impulse as a moral one, even as she worried that her art involved the exploitation of those she wrote about. \n\nThe new book does enrich that project, if slowly; it starts off as a skillful retread and then shifts. The first essay finds Jamison in a familiar pose, homing in on the “loneliest whale in the world,” 52 Blue, whose high-pitched song other whales cannot detect. The topic, with its built-in yearning, is lodged almost comically deep within Jamison’s wheelhouse. People embrace 52 Blue as a celebrity, a metaphor for their isolation. Jamison makes of him a meta-metaphor, a figure for our hunger to turn animals into mirrors. On one hand, she is charmed that so many humans see themselves in a whale, and want him to find happiness. But empathy can also obscure the object of examination: Blue’s fans, Jamison suggests, are perhaps less moved by nature’s variousness than by “the imprint of [their] own gaze.”\n\nA second essay, in which Jamison attempts to identify with those who believe in reincarnation, further questions the value of connection, the signature moral gesture of “The Empathy Exams.” Jamison considers a boy who claims to have fought, in a past life, in the Second World War. “Maybe I wasn’t doing anyone any favors by pretending that my belief system was tolerant enough to hold everything as equally valid,” she writes. “Maybe there were experiences I couldn’t relate to and things I might never believe.” This passage, from an author dedicated to imaginatively inhabiting others, reads as a crisis of faith. But the tension doesn’t last. Jamison solves the problem of reincarnation’s implausibility by evading it: she’s not interested in reincarnation itself; she’s interested in it as a metaphor. She wonders whether the migrating soul, by vanishing into another while simultaneously remaining the same, might contain the paradox of empathy. The earlier concern about empathy as a framework—that there is perhaps a narcissism to assuming that selves are interchangeable, or that one’s own perspective is universal—is forgotten. \n\nThis move becomes a motif. The opening third of “Make It Scream, Make It Burn” locates honesty in irresolution; ambiguity becomes a shorthand for insight, a signpost to the profound. (“We return,” Jamison writes, summarizing her views on the afterlife, “unless we can’t.”) In “Sim Life,” Jamison examines a computer game, Second Life, in which users create virtual selves. Presented with a hobby that some might dismiss as pathetic, Jamison’s empathy engine begins to rev, to seek “beauty in what other people found absurd.” But the essay starts to slide off the rails. In truth, Jamison admits, she thinks that Second Life is creepy. She is gripped not by the platform but by the spell it casts on its players. Their enthusiasm, she writes, reveals a broadly applicable truth: that “inhabiting any life always involves reckoning with the urge to abandon it”; that, in fact, “these forms of ‘leaving’ aren’t the opposite of authentic presence.” \n\nIt’s a stirring point. (See again: “collection of essays by Leslie Jamison.”) It also replicates the arc in which Jamison moves from what she cannot relate to (liking a certain computer game) to what she can (dreams of escape, the sting of desire itself). In the process, she avoids interrogating her empathic impulse, even as her skeptical setup feints in that direction. There is nothing wrong with Jamison’s thesis: reaching and imagining are, in fact, good. But she can seem, at times, to be throwing complexity in her own way merely to exercise her thoughtfulness. The resulting essays adopt uncertainty almost as style rather than as subject. Reasoning by metaphor allows Jamison to please everyone. She can grant that the whale is likely just a mass of blubber, overburdened by human meaning, while also gesturing toward abstract ideas of loneliness and longing. The reader begins to sense an abdication. Jamison cares that we care about the whale. But what does she believe?\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nThe book’s second group of essays, gathered under the heading “Looking,” sheds some light on Jamison’s allergy to staking out opinions. The theme of the section is the artist’s responsibility to those she depicts. Jamison’s subjects, all of whom bend, like her, toward self-critique, include the Civil War photographer Mathew Brady; James Agee, who documented the lives of poor Alabamans in “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men”; and the photographer Annie Appel, whose quarter-century-long project representing a Mexican family blurs the line between love and obsession. These artists, inscribing their limits within their work, enact what Jamison considers to be the most honest solution to the impossibility of an objective gaze. As she writes, “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men” does not simply describe sharecroppers; it “forces us into the anguish of Agee’s attempt to do this describing,” through “thwarted narratives and self-sabotaging journalism&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. convoluted syntax and tortuous abstractions&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. feelings of attachment and—beyond and beneath all else—guilt.” \n\nJamison insists that the “weight of witnessing” cannot exist “without the ghost of the witness.” She urges artists to own the taint of their artifice, which, she writes, expresses “something deeply authentic—the longing to glorify, to immortalize, to preserve.” But this effort to honor the represented has the effect of centering the representer. Jamison, for whom the themes of imagination, narration, and metaphor will never not be seductive, endlessly elevates the act of portrayal above the thing being portrayed. While this doesn’t invalidate her ethical inquiries, it does reorient them—a critique she anticipates with an observation about “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men” that doubles as a searing self-assessment. “The drama of Agee’s vexed relationship to the possibility of moral failure,” Jamison writes, “more than the plight of the families themselves, is the closest thing to a plot that his book ever attempts.” \n\nThat Jamison’s essays are continually searching for their true subject, like wanderers on romantic quests, contributes to their aura of rigor and humility. But seeking can become its own kind of stasis, and I caught myself wishing, as I read this new volume, for Jamison to push beyond articulate hunger. In a third section, titled “Dwelling,” she does. Where “The Empathy Exams” began with the personal and then broadened its focus, “Make It Scream, Make It Burn” traces a reverse course from criticism to memoir, angling its last group of essays at the author’s intimate relationships. Here, Jamison writes about going to weddings as a single woman, meeting her husband, inhabiting the role of stepmother, and navigating pregnancy. Instead of universalizing her experience into myth, she divulges the biographical facts that have helped to shape her creative preoccupations. Her dad was often away on business. Her brother was a mystery to her. Surrounded by unavailable men, “I’d developed an attachment to the state of yearning,” Jamison writes. “I no longer desired presence; in fact, I often had no idea what to do with men when they stuck around.”\n\nSome of these late-arriving pieces explicitly rework earlier topics. “The Real Smoke”—about flying to Vegas in pursuit of a man, and returning, fifteen months later, to marry a different one—is “Sim Life,” cast in desert fluorescence. Las Vegas “understood that any time you were somewhere, there were a thousand elsewheres you might be longing for,” Jamison writes. “So it jammed them together: New York—New York /Paris, the Tropicana, the Mirage.” The person that Jamison ends up marrying grew up in Vegas. Dating him forces her to reconceptualize the city not as a symbol—a palimpsest of elsewheres—but as a real location. Digging into her routines as a spouse and a mother, Jamison begins to push back against the displacements of metaphor, narrating the process of learning to “dwell in the building I’d chosen.” Marriage, she writes, is what happens when “the mirage shimmers away to reveal plain asphalt straight ahead.”\n\nThis is a loss and a relief. When Jamison trades “the electricity of thresholds” for “the daily work of salvage and sustenance,” she leaves behind some of what made “The Empathy Exams” a phenomenon: the pleasure of its pining. But she also captures the sensuality of having—the down-to-earth textures of gritted teeth, boredom, and buying your stepdaughter the wrong princess doll. If “Make It Scream, Make It Burn” at times feels invested in challenging Jamison’s earlier ideas about empathy, what it actually moderates is her romanticism. In the “Dwelling” pieces, dreams no longer supersede reality. The artist’s drama no longer veils the subject. Ironically, this adjustment also loosens the empathy knot. It is true that the distance between who you are and who you long to be—as a woman, as a writer—is interesting. But, as Jamison realizes, there are many ways to be interesting. A whale being a whale is interesting. Jamison being herself is interesting. To be released from metaphor is not the same as to be cut off from meaning.

S. Eliot](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/09/19/practical-cat)—just thirty years old and working as a clerk in the foreign-exchange division of Lloyds Bank in London—sat down and wrote his manifesto as a poet and critic, “Tradition and the Individual Talent.” Its effects were hardly immediate. The essay appeared in the September and December, 1919, issues of *The Egoist*, the London-based little magazine for which Eliot had been serving as an assistant editor since June, 1917\\. These would turn out to be the last issues that the magazine would publish. A “Notice to Readers” in the December issue announced a hiatus for 1920; the editor Harriet Shaw Weaver wanted to focus her energies on publishing books. That pause would prove to be a full stop. Not many could have been disappointed at the announcement: *The Egoist*, by its end, boasted a print run of just four hundred, and a mere forty-five subscribers. In “[Paradise Lost](https://www.amazon.com/Paradise-Lost-Penguin-Classics-Milton/dp/0140424393),” Milton argued for the sufficiency of a “fit audience&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. though few”—but there are limits.\n\nThough “Tradition” was initially seen only by a coterie audience, it is Eliot’s most important essay—and arguably, the most influential English-language literary essay of the twentieth century. From that modest début, its reach has grown exponentially. Within a year, the piece was included in Eliot’s first critical collection, “[The Sacred Wood](https://www.amazon.com/Sacred-Wood-Essays-Poetry-Criticism/dp/1614277699),” published in November, 1920\\. It subsequently appeared in the three other volumes assembled by Eliot, including “[Selected Essays](https://www.amazon.com/Selected-Essays-T-S-Eliot/dp/0151803870),” which itself went through three different editions. In that collection, “Tradition” has the pole position.\n\nAnd it wasn’t the first choice of Eliot alone. “[The Norton Anthology of English Literature](https://www.amazon.com/Norton-Anthology-English-Literature-Package/dp/039360313X),” that canon-creating textbook par excellence, has included the essay in every one of its ten editions, dating back to 1962; in that first edition, Eliot is the only twentieth-century poet whose criticism is represented. “Tradition” is further reproduced in all nine editions of Norton’s American-literature anthology (as an American expatriate, Eliot is hard on taxonomies, and both the British and the Americans tend to claim him) and many other literature textbooks. The essay has been an important part of the literature survey curriculum for more than half a century. “Tradition” is the criticism that critics read when they’re figuring out that they want to be critics. In the literature and literary criticism of the twentieth century, it’s simply unavoidable.\n\nIn 1919, Eliot could boast only a thin volume of poems and a handful of essays and reviews, but he had confidence to spare. In a letter sent to his mother, back in St. Louis, in March of that year—six months, that is, before he published the first essay he would deem worthy of reprinting—he wrote, “I really think that I have far more *influence* on English letters than any other American has ever had, unless it be Henry James.” It’s an outlandish claim, even if one allows for the kind of hyperbole to be found in a letter meant to impress one’s parents. (To be fair, he does go on to admit, “All this sounds very conceited.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;”) “Tradition” is stamped with the voice of a young man intoxicated with a belief in his own authority; as he wrote in that same letter, “I can have more than enough power to satisfy me.” In “Tradition,” we first see him flex those muscles.\n\nThe essay is a challenge to the conventions of early twentieth-century literary criticism. Eliot’s most concise statement of his thesis comes at the start of the December installment: “Honest criticism and sensitive appreciation is directed not upon the poet but upon the poetry.” That literary criticism should focus on texts might seem axiomatic; that it ought not pay attention to the author is perhaps less obvious. Eliot is reacting to a wave of criticism in which study of the poet had too often been substituted for study of the poetry—an orientation sometimes known as biographical criticism and which, in the generation following Eliot’s essay, would be dubbed the “biographical fallacy.” In Chapter 2 of “[Ulysses](https://www.amazon.com/Ulysses-James-Joyce/dp/0679722769),” Stephen Dedalus’s employer, Mr. Deasy, lectures him about frugality: “But what does Shakespeare say? *Put but money in thy purse*.” Stephen mutters a single word under his breath in response: “Iago.” Stephen is, after his fashion, pushing back against the biographical fallacy. “Shakespeare” didn’t “say” that; rather, it was voiced by perhaps the most monstrous of all his characters. Iago’s statement reflects nothing, necessarily, about Shakespeare’s own values and judgments. As Eliot writes of the poet in general, “emotions which he has never experienced will serve his turn as well as those familiar to him.” And this applies not just to named literary characters—the “I” that speaks in lyric poetry is also a character, not entirely coincident with the writer who formed that character on the page. “The more perfect the artist,” Eliot insists, “the more completely separate in him will be the man who suffers and the mind which creates; the more perfectly will the mind digest and transmute the passions which are its material.” This is the creative license that makes imaginative literature possible. And, in 1919, Eliot thought it to be in jeopardy.\n\n“Tradition” is filled with mannerisms that become familiar across the body of Eliot’s critical writing. For instance, he betrays a particular fondness for the vast generalization and the unsupported assertion—unsupported, that is to say, but for the magisterial tone and sonorous sweep of his prose. Take, for instance, the opening gambit of “Tradition”: “In English writing we seldom speak of tradition, though we occasionally apply its name in deploring its absence.” Before the era of big data and text mining, what would evidence for such a claim even look like? By means of that “we” (not the royal “we” so much as the faux-communal “we”), Eliot as much as suggests that this is conventional wisdom—what kind of a pedant would insult our intelligence by proving it? Likewise, two years later, in “The Metaphysical Poets,” he will insist, making a virtue of necessity, “We can only say that it appears likely that poets in our civilization, as it exists at present, must be *difficult*.” One of the most daring critical pronouncements of Eliot’s career—the assertion that difficulty isn’t an unfortunate artifact but actually the litmus test of advanced writing—is just dropped on the page as if it were too painfully obvious to warrant discussion. The scholar Leonard Diepeveen aptly describes this feature of Eliot’s critical prose: “Though he regularly asserts the need for evidence, Eliot doesn’t often provide it.”\n\nWhat makes “Tradition” such a durable touchstone? In it, Eliot essentially declares Romanticism dead to rights, insinuating that modernism (without employing that label) is the new king. (His friend, the poet-critic T.&nbsp;E. Hulme, had already performed the autopsy roughly seven years earlier, in his essay “Romanticism and Classicism”—but Hulme was killed in the First World War, and the piece wasn’t published until 1924\\.) [William Wordsworth](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/12/05/strange-fits-of-passion), in the key text of Romantic poetics, the preface to “[Lyrical Ballads](https://www.amazon.com/Lyrical-Ballads-Penguin-Classics-Wordsworth/dp/0140424628),” from 1800, had urged that “all good poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. recollected in tranquility.” (Which is nothing if not categorical—unproven and unprovable. Eliot wasn’t the only poet partial to such pronouncements.) In “Tradition,” Eliot explicitly rejects that formula, calling it “inexact”: “it is neither emotion, nor recollection, nor, without distortion of meaning, tranquility.” Rather, Eliot insists, “Poetry is not a turning loose of emotion, but an escape from emotion; it is not the expression of personality, but an escape from personality.” And then the rim-shot, at which Eliot excelled: “But, of course, only those who have personality and emotions know what it means to want to escape from these things.” \n\nJust as he was inspired by the work of Hulme, Eliot was doubtless jolted by the fiery rhetoric of one young Stephen Dedalus, the protagonist of James Joyce’s “[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man](https://www.amazon.com/Portrait-Artist-Young-Thrift-Editions/dp/0486280500)” (also serialized in *The Egoist*, in 1914-15). Stephen, with confidence to spare himself, declared, “The artist, like the God of the creation, remains within or behind or beyond or above his handiwork, invisible, refined out of existence, indifferent, paring his fingernails.” There is good reason to doubt that Joyce, in 1915, took this stance quite as seriously as his autobiographical hero did; but if Stephen’s declaration was meant ironically, Eliot certainly didn’t hear it that way. In his hands, rather, this becomes the “impersonal theory of poetry”: “The progress of an artist is a continual self-sacrifice, a continual extinction of personality.”\n\nWait, what? The success as a poet is measured by the erasure of his personality? Eliot’s suggestion is both outlandish and already, in 1916, a critical commonplace. If Wordsworth promoted self-expression as the quintessence of poetry, his contemporary John Keats, in private correspondence, expressed concerns about what he called “the Wordsworthian or egotistical sublime.” Keats referred to himself as a “camelion Poet”: “the poet has&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no identity—he is certainly the most unpoetical of all God’s Creatures.” Keats, in 1818, had already propounded his own “impersonal theory of poetry,” one that Eliot certainly knew.\n\nIt’s a convention of poetry treatises to provide a memorable image of the poet and his role. In Percy Bysshe Shelley’s “[Defence of Poetry](https://www.amazon.com/Defence-Poetry-Other-Essays/dp/1438521774)” (written in 1821 and published posthumously, in 1840), the poet is something like an unconscious medium connecting the spirit and human realms. For Eliot, the poet doesn’t serve *as* a medium but *has* a medium: “The poet has, not a ‘personality’ to express,” Eliot writes, “but a particular medium&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and not a personality.” Certainly, Eliot knew how to create a memorable image. “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,” the first of his poems to garner widespread attention, does so from the get-go with the shocking conceit of its opening lines: “Let us go then, you and I, / When the evening is spread out against the sky / Like a patient etherised upon a table.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;” In “Tradition,” his image of the poet is equally outré: “I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. invite you to consider, as a suggestive analogy, the action which takes place when a bit of finely filiated platinum is introduced into a chamber containing oxygen and sulphur dioxide.”\n\nThat is the last sentence of the September installment of the essay—a real cliff-hanger, by literary-critical standards. Eliot solves the riddle for us early in the December conclusion: “The mind of the poet is the shred of platinum.” That is to say, it’s a catalyst; it creates the conditions under which the two gases combine to form a new compound. (Critics would point out that the resulting compound is not, as Eliot states, sulphurous acid, but sulphur trioxide. But never mind that.) The catalyst, the platinum, isn’t affected by the reaction, nor does any trace of it appear in the new compound—but without it, the reaction does not take place. It is, as Shelley writes of the poet, “the influence which is moved not, but moves.”\n\nSo poetry, in Eliot’s description, has nothing to do with self-expression or inspiration or originality, as usually understood; the measure of the poet’s art is the pressure he brings to bear on those raw materials, those chemical precursors. And, in turn, literary criticism, when it’s doing its job properly—for every poetic manifesto is also, none too subtly, a set of instructions for critics—leaves the private life of the poet to one side. Many have pointed out how this is a convenient position for Eliot to adopt, given that he had recently begun work on “[The Waste Land](https://www.amazon.com/Waste-Land-Norton-Critical-Editions/dp/0393974995)”—a poem full of autobiographical detail from which he was anxious to distance himself, including anguished dialogue closely modelled on, if not directly quoted from, his first wife Vivien Haigh-Wood.\n\nIn another of Eliot’s descriptions, the mind of the poet is “a receptacle for seizing and storing up numberless feelings, phrases, images, which remain there until all the particles which can unite to form a new compound are present together.” On this score as well, the essay would seem to be clearing important ground (consciously or not) for “The Waste Land,” a pastiche of quotations and echoes and parodies—a poem that carried footnotes, for heaven’s sake, so nervous was Eliot about being accused of plagiarism. The chemistry-lab metaphor is ostentatiously scientific, or at least pseudo-scientific; Eliot’s science envy is on display as well in his 1923 review of “Ulysses,” in which he writes that Joyce’s contemporary use of classical myth “has the importance of a scientific discovery.” In one of the best-known maxims from the previous generation of art critics, Walter Pater (in another unsupported assertion) had declared that “all art constantly aspires to the condition of music.” In “Tradition,” Eliot closely echoes—the better to reject—Pater’s claim: “in this depersonalisation&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. art may be said to approach the condition of science.”\n\nEliot’s argument is encapsulated in the duelling poles of his title, which might almost read “Tradition *vs.* the Individual Talent.” In that fight, Eliot is rooting for what he sees as the underdog, tradition—the foundational essay of modern literary criticism is fundamentally conservative. Eliot is also, quietly, biting the hand that feeds him (and writes his paycheck). *The Egoist* carried a subtitle, “An Individualist Review”; in its pages, Eliot seeks to put individualism in its place. [Louis Menand](https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/louis-menand), in his 1987 book about Eliot, points out the perverse bad manners of such a move, describing Eliot in this period as “critiquing the avant-garde in the leading avant-garde forum of the day&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. provoking those writers on their own ground and as one of their number.”\n+++inline-recirc\n+++\nIn the essay’s other most striking image (and claim), Eliot suggests that each work of art is part of a vast trans-historical system, a sort of virtual bookshelf containing “the whole of the literature of Europe from Homer”—one that might, at any moment, be rearranged by “the introduction of the new (the really new) work of art.” “The existing order is complete,” Eliot explains, “before the new work arrives; for order to persist after the supervention of novelty, the *whole* existing order must be, if ever so slightly, altered.” Which is to suggest, rather counterintuitively, that artistic influence runs both ways across time: the past is “altered by the present as much as the present is directed by the past.” The author David Lodge makes use of this paradox in his 1984 academic farce “[Small World](https://www.amazon.com/Small-World-David-Lodge/dp/0140244867),” whose young academic Persse McGarrigle is writing a Master’s thesis on “The Influence of T.&nbsp;S. Eliot on Shakespeare.” The title is both a joke—part of Lodge’s satire—and not.\n\nLooking back with the hindsight of a hundred years, it’s now possible to see Eliot’s remarks on the reciprocal nature of influence as one of the earliest attempts to formulate what would come to be called “intertextuality”—the notion that to write is always to echo other writing (and thereby to alter that earlier writing by wrestling it into new contexts). Roland Barthes, in his rhapsodic 1967 essay “[The Death of the Author](https://www.amazon.com/Roland-Barthess-Death-Author-Library/dp/1912453061),” claims that “the text is a tissue of quotations&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a multi-dimensional space in which a variety of writings, none of them original, blend and clash.” Barthes’s multi-dimensional space sounds for all the world like Eliot’s description of the mind of the poet—but it’s even more purely impersonal than what Eliot had imagined. The space is no longer conceived as existing within the poet, but without. It’s the text itself.\n\nFifty years after Eliot’s manifesto, French cultural theorists like Barthes and Michel Foucault (in “[What Is an Author?](https://www.amazon.com/Michel-Foucaults-Author-Macat-Library/dp/1912453088)” from 1969)—as their titles might suggest—took Eliot’s impersonality theory to the nth degree, planting a post- in front of his modernism and humanism. If, for Eliot, the author was a kind of flesh-and-blood beaker, for the French poststructuralists, the author was purely a fiction, a heuristic device—what Foucault called the “author function.” Meanwhile, fifty years after the death of the author was announced and a century after Eliot’s belated obituary for Romanticism, “Tradition” still pulses with energy and life, what the poststructuralists would have called *jouissance*. Whether the influence is direct or indirect—whether a given literary essay has been influenced by Eliot’s critical brio, or by one who has been influenced by it—literary criticism today everywhere bears his impress.\n\nEven more directly, Eliot the schoolmaster continues to influence students of literature. The pedagogical strategy of “close reading” that evolved in Eliot’s wake, wherein students are taught to focus exclusively on the words on the page—and taught that the “I” of “I wandered lonely as a cloud” is not Wordsworth but the poem’s speaker, a literary character—these are the starting points of every consequential contemporary literary-critical argument. The kind of close reading for which Eliot was arguing in 1919 remains the foundation of literary criticism in 2019—even if critics now think of it as a starting point, not a terminus. Thus, as W. H. Auden wrote about the legacy of W. B. Yeats, “The words of a dead man / Are modified in the guts of the living.”\n\n","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1cbcb75f002c8941e4d8","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1cbcb75f002c8941e4d8","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"T.

S. Eliot, a man who adopted all\nthe attributes—political, religious, cultural, and sartorial—of a proper\nEnglishman was actually a Midwesterner. But, of course, he grew up in\nSt. Louis, and some of the landscapes that seem distinctly English to\nmany readers in his poetry, like the “yellow fog” in “The Love Song of\nJ. Alfred Prufrock,” were recollected from his childhood there.\n\nThe Eliots were originally from New England, though. Eliot’s\ngrandfather, William Greenleaf Eliot, moved to Missouri as a young man\nand eventually founded Washington University, in St. Louis. Eliot’s\nfather, Henry, who ran a company that manufactured bricks, took the\nfamily to Massachusetts every summer, and in 1896, the year Eliot turned\neight, Henry built a big house on Cape Ann, in Gloucester, overlooking\nthe outer harbor. Until Eliot went off to Europe, in 1914, he spent his\nsummers there.\n\nEliot often talked about his nostalgia for the sea off the Eastern\nPoint, where he used to sail, and for the granite, the tide pools, and\nthe birdlife of Cape Ann, memories that gave rise to many images in his\npoetry:\n\n> The salt is on the briar rose,  \n> The fog is in the fir trees.\n\nThe lines are from “The Dry Salvages,” the third of Eliot’s “Four\nQuartets,” which was published in, of all places, the left-wing\n*Partisan Review*, in 1941. The poem is built around references to two\nbodies of water, the Mississippi River and the North Atlantic. The title\n(“salvages” is pronounced like “rampages”) is the name of a rock\nformation three miles off the coast of Rockport, Massachusetts. When a\nfriend read a draft of the poem and worried that readers would assume\nthe title was symbolic and would try to puzzle out a distinction between\n“wet” and “dry” forms of some metaphorical “salvage,” Eliot added a note\nidentifying the source. (Eliot was not averse to adding notes.) “The Dry\nSalvages” is a place name. All the titles in “Four Quartets” are place\nnames.\n\nHenry Eliot died in 1919, and the Cape Ann house was sold. By then, T.\nS. Eliot had dropped out of the doctoral program in the Harvard\nphilosophy department, married, and settled in London, and he didn’t\nvisit Cape Ann again until he was in his late sixties and married to his\nsecond wife, Valerie. He died in 1965; Valerie died in 2012. In 2015,\nthe Gloucester house became available and was purchased by the T. S.\nEliot Foundation, which has turned into a writers’ retreat. (The\nprevious owners had already done restoration work.) This summer, some\nthirteen writers, mostly poets, are staying there, four or five at a\ntime, averaging about three weeks each.\n\nI visited the house—now called Eliot House—this spring. There has been a\nlot of construction on the Eastern Point since 1919, as you would\nexpect, and you can no longer see the ocean from the porch, as\nphotographs show you once could. But the house is still relatively\nsecluded, a sprawling, airy place, with porches, sitting areas, and\nbedroom after bedroom—Eliot was the youngest of six children—with great\ngranite boulders in the yard outside. It’s a late Victorian summer house\nwith a twenty-first-century kitchen. It’s nothing like the gaudy\n“cottages” of Newport. Henry Eliot did not have that kind of money, it’s\ntrue, but he evidently didn’t have Gilded Age taste, either.\n\nWhy is there a T. S. Eliot Foundation with money to buy a big house in a\nfashionable neighborhood on the North Shore and pay for poets to live\nthere? The answer is “Cats.” The musical is based on Eliot’s “[Old\nPossum’s Book of Practical\nCats](https://www.amazon.com/Old-Possums-Book-Practical-Cats/dp/015668568X),”\na children’s book that had the good fortune to have once been read by a\nchild named Andrew Lloyd Webber. Since it opened, in 1981, “Cats” has\nhad nearly nine thousand performances in London and more than six\nthousand on Broadway. A motion picture is in the works. “Cats” is a\nroyalty stream that paperback books of poetry do not produce.\n\nThe foundation descends from a trust established by Valerie Eliot, in\n1990. It now has about seven million pounds in assets, translating into\na quarter of a million pounds in donations a year. A quarter of a\nmillion pounds won’t buy you much of a border wall, but in the world of\nthe arts a very little money can go a very long way. The annual budgets\nof the National Endowment for the Arts and similar programs are\nminuscule by the standards of government spending, but those\norganizations support hundreds of people and institutions.\n\nThe new director of the T. S. Eliot Foundation, Clare Reihill, who had\nbeen in book publishing, has been active in diversifying the objects of\nthe foundation’s largesse. As you would expect, a lot of the awards go\nto theatres, literary festivals, libraries—the sort of things Eliot was\nprofessionally devoted to. There is a T. S. Eliot Poetry Prize, worth\ntwenty thousand pounds.\n\nAs you might not expect, the foundation also gives funds to groups that\nwork with refugees. One grant went to the organization [Edlumino\nEducation Aid](https://www.edlumino.org), which helps educate Syrian\nchildren in Greek refugee camps. And the foundation presents a series of\n“Dead Poets Live” readings in England—this fall, Glenda Jackson, who\nonce played Stevie Smith in a movie, will read Smith’s poems—with the\nproceeds going to Safe Passage, an organization that helps refugees\n“find safe, legal routes to the U.K.” and supports their “transition to\na new life.”\n\nOne doesn’t see the reactionary editor of *The* *Criterion*—and the\nolder Eliot was a true reactionary, an enemy of liberalism and\nsecularism, which is why people were startled to see his poetry in\n*Partisan Review*—reaching out to immigrants. Eliot had a fundamentalist\nidea about the relation of cultural roots to geographic ones. That’s\nwhy all of the “Quartets” are named for places. “It would appear to be\nfor the best that the great majority of people should go on living in\nthe place in which they were born,” he wrote, in 1943. He was evidently\nnot looking in the mirror when he came up with that thought.

Yet everyone he knew seemed to be addicted. His wife at the time, Mary McCarthy, was in the habit of recommending her favorite detective novels to their émigré pal Vladimir Nabokov; she lent him H. F. Heard’s beekeeper whodunit “A Taste for Honey,” which the Russian author enjoyed while recovering from dental surgery. (After reading Wilson’s essay, Nabokov advised his friend not to dismiss the genre _tout court_ until he’d tried some Dorothy L. Sayers.) Surrounded on all sides by detection connoisseurs, Wilson sounded genuinely perplexed when he wondered, “What, then, is the spell of the detective story that has been felt by T. S. Eliot and Paul Elmer More but which I seem to be unable to feel?”\n\n\n\n\n\nThat [T. S. Eliot](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/09/19/practical-cat), of all people, was a devoted fan of the genre must have rankled Wilson in particular. Eliot, the author of famously difficult and formidably learned poems, whose every critical pronouncement was seized upon by dons and converted into doctrine, was an unimpeachable authority in matters of literary judgment. Wilson, indeed, had played a part in establishing Eliot’s reputation as such, having gushed, in his era-defining study “Axel’s Castle” (1931), that the poet-critic had an “infinitely sensitive apparatus for aesthetic appreciation”—a sensitivity presumably not worth squandering on something as puerile and formulaic as mysteries.\n\n\n\nBut, as scholars like [David Chinitz](https://books.google.com/books?id=z-G1zjPAWIwC&q=) have pointed out, Eliot’s attitude toward popular art forms was more capacious and ambivalent than he’s often given credit for. His most formally ambitious poetry retained something of the jumpy syncopations of the ragtime he’d heard growing up in St. Louis; in his later years he wanted nothing more than to have a hit on Broadway. And it so happens that, well before detective stories came into vogue among Wilson’s cohort, Eliot had become one of the genre’s most passionate and discerning readers. Among the many treasures to be found in the third volume of “The Complete Prose of T. S. Eliot,” which is now out from Johns Hopkins University Press, are a number of reviews of detective novels which Eliot published, with no byline, in his literary journal _The Criterion_, in 1927. In them, we see not only Eliot’s passion for detective fiction but his attempts to codify the genre in the midst of some of its most momentous evolutions.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nEliot was composing his reviews in the early years of detective fiction’s Golden Age, when authors like Sayers, Agatha Christie, and John Dickson Carr were churning out genteel whodunits featuring motley arrays of suspects and outlandish murder methods. More even than the stories of Poe or Doyle, the early work that to Eliot served as a model for the genre was “The Moonstone,” by Wilkie Collins, a sprawling melodrama about the theft and recovery of an Indian diamond, which appeared in serial installments in Charles Dickens’s _All the Year Round_ magazine in 1868. In his introduction to the 1928 Oxford World Classics edition of the novel, Eliot called it “the first, the longest and the best of modern English detective novels.” (This blurb still adorns Oxford paperback editions.) The story is full of protracted plot twists and portentous cliffhangers, many of them not of particular relevance to the mystery at hand; we are told as much about the reading habits of the house-steward, a fan of “Robinson Crusoe,” and the fraught romance between the handsome Franklin Blake and the impetuous Rachel Verinder, as we are about the circumstances surrounding the heist. For Eliot, such digressions helped lend the mystery an “intangible human element.” In a review written in the January, 1927, issue of _The Criterion_, he claimed that all good detective fiction “tends to return and approximate to the practice of Wilkie Collins.”\n\n\n\n\n\nA key tenet of Golden Age detection was “fair play”—the idea that an attentive reader must in theory have as good a shot at solving the mystery as the story’s detective. To establish parameters of fairness, Eliot suggests that “the character and motives of the criminal should be normal” and that “elaborate and incredible disguises” should be banned; he writes that a good detective story must not “rely either upon occult phenomena or … discoveries made by lonely scientists,” and that “elaborate and bizarre machinery is an irrelevance.” The latter rule would seem to exclude masterpieces like Doyle’s “The Adventure of the Speckled Band,” which involves a murder carried out by a snake trained to shimmy through a heating duct, then down a bell rope whose tassel extends to the victim’s pillow. But Eliot admitted that most great works broke at least one of his rules. He in fact adored Arthur Conan Doyle, and was given to quoting long passages from the Holmes tales verbatim at parties, and to borrowing bits and ideas for his poems. (He confessed in a letter to John Hayward that the line “On the edge of a grimpen,” from “Four Quartets,” alludes to the desolate Grimpen Mire in “The Hound of the Baskervilles.”)\n\n\n\nIn the June, 1927, issue of _The Criterion_, Eliot continued to articulate his standards, reviewing another sixteen novels and drawing fine distinctions between mysteries, chronicles of true crimes, and detective stories proper. His favorite of the bunch was “The Benson Murder Case,” by S. S. Van Dine. One of the few American writers to factor into Eliot’s analyses of detective fiction, Van Dine was the pen name of Willard Huntington Wright, an art critic, freelance journalist, and sometime editor of _The Smart Set_, who, after suffering a nervous breakdown, spent two years in bed reading more than two thousand detective stories, during which time he methodically distilled the genre’s formulas and began writing novels. His detective, Philo Vance, was a leisurely aesthete prone to mini-lectures on Tanagra figurines, who approached detective work, as Eliot put it admiringly, “using methods similar to those which Mr. Bernard Berenson applies to paintings.”\n\n\n\nIn 1928, Van Dine would publish his own “Twenty Rules for Writing Detective Stories” in _The American Magazine_; that same year, Ronald A. Knox—a Catholic priest and member of the mystery-writer’s group London Detection Club, along with Dorothy Sayers, Agatha Christie, and G. K. Chesterton—would put forth his Ten Commandments of detective fiction. It is hard to know if these authors would have been aware of Eliot’s own rules, published the year before, but many of their principles echo Eliot’s parameters of fair play: Van Dine wrote that “no willful tricks or deceptions may be placed on the reader”; the Detection Club’s Oath, which was based on Knox’s commandments, required its members to promise that their stories would avoid making use of “Divine Revelation, Feminine Intuition, Mumbo-Jumbo, Jiggery-Pokery, Coincidence, or the Act of God.” (Christie had tested the limits of fairness with the twist-ending of her 1926 novel “The Murder of Roger Ackroyd,” causing a stir among devotees of the genre; in 1945 Edmund Wilson, having been deluged with angry mail after his first piece was published, wrote a follow-up titled “Who Cares Who Killed Roger Ackroyd?,” in which he deemed his experience reading a second batch of mystery novels “even more disillusioning than my expe­rience with the first.”)\n\n\n\nBut in comparing Eliot’s reviews with the rules of these detective-fiction insiders, we can see just how idiosyncratic Eliot’s judgments could be. Where Van Dine specifies that “a detective novel should contain no long descriptive passages, no literary dallying with side-issues, no subtly worked out character analyses”—exactly the qualities Eliot so admired in “The Moonstone”—Eliot, ever the literary historian, saw the genre as stemming from a deeper tradition of melodrama, which for him included everything from Jacobean revenge tragedies to “Bleak House.” “Those who have lived before such terms as ‘high-brow fiction,’ ‘thrillers’ and ‘detective fiction’ were invented,” Eliot wrote in an essay on Wilkie Collins and Dickens, “realize that melodrama is perennial and that the craving for it is perennial.” Good detective fiction tempered the passion and pursuit of melodrama with the “beauty of a mathematical problem”; an unsuccessful story, Eliot wrote, was one that “fails between two possible tasks … the pure intellectual pleasure of Poe and the fullness and abundance of life of Collins.” What he appreciated, in other words, was the genre’s capacity for conveying intensity of sentiment and human experience within taut formal designs—a quality that might just as soon apply to literary fiction or poetry.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nIt is disappointing, then, that Eliot’s reviews included no opinions on the new kind of literary detective novel that was taking shape across the ocean. At precisely the moment when Eliot was laying down his rules in _The Criterion_, Dashiell Hammett, a former Pinkerton detective and an enthusiastic reader of “The Waste Land,” was in the process of serializing his tale of a jewel-encrusted statuette in the pages of _Black Mask._ Hammett’s “The Maltese Falcon” marked a shift in detective fiction, away from decorous country-house puzzles into a meaner, starker, bleaker kind of urban crime thriller, in which the mechanics of the crime were often less essential than the atmosphere through which the characters moved. With the advent of this “hardboiled” style, the British murder mysteries began to seem quaint and artificial. (In his 1950 essay “The Simple Art of Murder,” Raymond Chandler would deem Van Dine’s Philo Vance “probably the most asinine character in detective fiction.”) One wonders what Eliot, who built his great poem around the Grail legend, would have made of “The Maltese Falcon,” with its cosmopolite eccentrics chasing after a shadowy MacGuffin with a history going back to the Knights Templar. And one wonders what, with his more-British-than-the-British expat sensibilities, he would have made of this bold new American literature.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s possible, though, that Eliot’s affinity for Golden Age detective stories had only partially to do with the genre’s literary merits. During the year he wrote his mystery reviews, Eliot was undergoing a sharp turn to the right politically, and was steeped in dense works of theology in preparation for his baptism into the Anglo-Catholic church. (In a June, 1927, letter to his friend Virginia Woolf he described himself, only half-jokingly, as a “person who specializes in detective stories and ecclesiastical history.”) His conversion to a man of royalist proclivities and religious faith, after which he attended Mass every morning before heading off to work in Russell Square, was at least in part a matter of giving order to a world he saw as intolerably messy. At the end of his 1944 essay, Edmund Wilson suggested that it was no accident that the Golden Age of detection coincided with the period between the two World Wars: in a shattered civilization, there was something reassuring about the detective’s ability to link up all the broken fragments and “know just where to fix the guilt.” Such tidy solutions were to Wilson the mark of glib and simplistic genre fiction. But to Eliot, who in “The Waste Land” wrote of the fractured modern world as a “heap of broken images,” it seems possible that Golden Age detective stories offered above all a pleasing orderliness—a way of seeing ghastly disruptions restored to equilibrium with the soothing predictability of ritual.","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/what-makes-great-detective-fiction-according-to-t-s-eliot","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1d9041c92e2c9b85db4b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Crime Fiction","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"crime-fiction"},{"id":"5c2e22194a08312cd3aa6fb1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Detective Stories","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"detective-stories"},{"id":"5c2e1c764a08312cd3aa6c35","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Literature","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"literature"},{"id":"5c2e1cbcb75f002c8941e4d8","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"T.

A memorial plaque was erected addressing posterity: “This monument is to acknowledge that we know what is happening and what needs to be done. Only you know if we did it.”\n\nThere is something chilling in any attempt to communicate with the eventual inheritors of the planet we are destroying. The challenge is existential (what can we say to them?) as well as practical (in what language should we say it?). At a nuclear-waste repository near Carlsbad, New Mexico, this is more than a thought experiment: the plant’s contents will remain hazardous for thousands of generations. Writers, artists, and sociologists hired by the United States Department of Energy have proposed marking the site with a note carved in granite, in several scripts: “This message is a warning about danger.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The danger is still present, in your time, as it was in ours.” Other suggestions have taken a more figurative approach: a version of Edvard Munch’s painting “The Scream”; an array of enormous, menacing stone spikes. There is no dispelling the anxiety, however, that it may not be possible to fully account or atone for what we have wrought. All of these tentative messages speak not only to an uncertain future but also to an uncertain present, and what they convey is that we have no idea how to tell our story. Even if we did, would anyone listen?\n\n“[A Sand Book](https://www.amazon.com/Sand-Book-Ariana-Reines/dp/1947793322),” the audacious new collection by the poet, playwright, translator, and performance artist Ariana Reines, asks what it means to try to make meaning in the shadow of an end time. The book is a psychedelic epic about climate change and forever war; capitalism and surveillance; gun violence and police brutality; fascism and genocide; diaspora, mental illness, gender, and the occult. These subjects are inseparable from the signs and symbols by which, in our media-glutted moment, they are relentlessly articulated—or, as the case may be, obscured. If today’s world can seem incomprehensible, so, too, can the ways we discuss it; last week’s news, takes, memes, and trends quickly dissolving into so many ancient runes. “We were lost in a language of images. / It was growing difficult to speak,” Reines writes in the poem “A Partial History”: “Yet talk / Was everywhere.” Amid the chaos, she takes on the role of reluctant oracle or interpreter, dogged by glimpses of revelation, yet hesitant to accept, or impose, any pretense of coherence.\n\n“A Partial History” is a bleak report from the twenty-first century: “Everything we did for our government / And the corporations that served it we did for free / In exchange for the privilege of watching one / Another break down.” The state of crisis Reines describes is, like the state itself, inescapably brutal, exacting a complicity so pervasive it infiltrates the very body: “Our skin was the same wall they talked about on the news / And our hearts were the bombs whose threat never withdrew.” That “the dominant / Rhetoric of the age, which some called sharing,” is characterized by hostility and exploitation is but one of that (read: this) age’s cruel ironies. Do all of our efforts at expression—the selfies, ads, *GIF*{:.small}s, emojis, avatars, and icons that comprise our shared “language of images”—illuminate the truth of our time, or confound it? If language is a technology—prone, like any other, to weaponization or obsoletion—will ours lead us out of dystopia, or only further into it, winding up an arcane relic of some fallen civilization? “A Partial History” concludes:\n\n> The images gave us no rest yet failed over\n\n> And over despite the immensity\n\n> Of their realism to describe the world as we really\n\n> Knew it, and worse, as it knew us  \n\nIn “A Sand Book,” capitalism’s parasitic effect on discourse mirrors its ransacking of the environment; Reines ties cultural and spiritual desiccation to literal desertification. In “Haboob,” whose title references the Arabic word for an extreme sandstorm, she diagnoses “Among likers *& shamers*{: .indent1} / The fear     *of a green planet*{: .indent1} / Fear *of a human planet*{: .indent1}.” Reines’s lamentations of hollowness and shallowness, mechanization and artifice, belong to an established poetic tradition—“I saw the best minds / I saw the best minds / I saw the best minds,” she intones, the engine of Ginsberg’s “Howl” turning over and over, refusing to start—and part of her frustration is their exhaustion. Over the years, these same complaints have accumulated into so much waste. “How long does it take a revolution to arrive?” she asks. “.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It had happened / And yet it still hadn’t arrived.   It was / An experience of dryness— / ‘An experience of the abyss.’&nbsp;” What hope is there for poetry at such an event horizon?\n\nIn “A Sand Book,” the threat of annihilation is not just speculative but historical. Reines reckons with patriarchy’s assaults and imperialism’s appetites, as well as more localized atrocities, like the genocidal campaign by *ISIS*{: .small} against the Yazidi people, whose mythology provides a recurring motif throughout the book’s twelve sections. She draws her title and epigraph from Paul Celan, who, late in his career, began an untitled poem, “*NO MORE SAND ART*{:.small}, no sand book, no masters.” Celan, a Romanian-born poet who survived the Holocaust, troubled notions of bearing witness in poetry, a medium he felt—like his Jewish heritage and the German language in which he wrote—was indelibly traumatized. For Reines, who is descended from survivors, and in whose poetry the Shoah looms large even when not explicitly centered, Celan is a crucial influence, a model of what poet and critic Cathy Park Hong [describes](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/articles/70218/against-witness) as “literature that is lifeblood against the sanctimonious, sanctioned poetry that the establishment uses to exonerate themselves.” Reines, like Celan, is ambivalent about the lyric’s capacity to contain and commute human suffering. In an interview in *The White Review*, she recently remarked, “I’ve been haunted by the old mode of writing, which I think of as ‘[righting](http://www.thewhitereview.org/feature/interview-ariana-reines/)’—seeking redemption, somehow, by rendering past events into art; into fiction, into vision, into some form of intellectual lucidity that could somehow free me from the shit of the real.” Or, as she [put it](http://www.actionyes.org/issue6/reines/reines-sucking.html) more than a decade ago, “Writing can be more than good.”\n\nThe journey “A Sand Book” narrates is not a hero’s triumph, then, but something messier, less readily legible. Traversing Central and Eastern Europe, New York, California, the Southwestern U. S., Buenos Aires, and Haiti, Reines resembles a cosmic outlaw, a modern-day wandering Jew, whose errancy and alienation disrupts illusions of order. “I was feeling kind / Of Auschwitzy in a vegan restaurant in Warsaw,” she writes, in “Pilgrims’ Progress,” observing the crass incongruity of “an H&M and a multiplex across the street // From the ghetto wall.” The collection’s first poem, “Desero,” defines the Latin verb—“*I forsake* / *I abandon* / *I give up*”—and the book is, indeed, about desertion, from a “vast unpaid army / Of self-destructors, false comrades, impotent / Brainiacs who wished to appear to be kind.” Defection from the mainstream is preferable to assimilation, and if the proverbial desert does not promise deliverance, it inspires a particular attunement. Out of perilous thirst arise all manner of mirages and visions. \n\nThe extreme and hostile conditions of our contemporary environment demand a measure of imperviousness—“Let the record show / I caused my flesh to thicken to protect // What you and your connivances / .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. / Would otherwise have dispersed.” And yet they can also give way to a radical sensitivity. In “Legend,” a barrier between the private self and its surroundings erodes, and a new, communal channel of perception emerges:\n\n> More grief was pouring  \nFrom me than I could comprehend  \n\n> & I was one  \nNot unaccustomed to grief  \n\n> This was the sorrow of a whole people  \nIt feels strange to declare  \n\n> It was yet stranger to behold passing  \nThrough me. “I” was not the one  \n\n> In tears. “It” was.  \n& there began my history  \n\nReines navigates existential calamity as she does literature and language—like a sieve or a singing bowl, receiving rather than contriving the patterns and resonances that evoke “the greater, deeper, more horrible / & boundlessly sweeter justice / of the unfathomable whole.” \n\nThis intellectual and emotional porousness has defined each of Reines’s previous collections: “[The Cow](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0977106470)” (2006), “[Cœur de Lion](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934200484)” (2007), and “[Mercury](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934200476)” (2011) all strive, in their own ways, for a sense of totality. But “A Sand Book” shows her consciousness at its most expansive and integrated to date. These poems understand nothing so well as their own inevitable incompleteness—that no composition could contain everything, that every history is partial. “Seeing / God hasn’t saved me,” Reines declares, in “Skull & Bones.” “The world keeps forcing / Its way in. ‘The world’ / Which fucking one. / You know the one. / And I was one / Of the lucky ones.” \n\nThis tension between the singular and the collective—the solitary grain and the great shifting dune—surfaces most dramatically in the last movement of “A Sand Book.” “Mosaic” records an astral encounter Reines undergoes in a moment of intense vulnerability, even abjection. “*The words aren’t ‘mine’*,” she explains in a preface to the transmission. “*Thoughtforms were being communicated to me whole.”* The unmediated utterance delivers a series of sweeping pronouncements, reassuring in their conviction if not necessarily their content: “*WE DO NEED EVERY KIND OF STORY*{:.small},” for example, but “*THERE WILL ALWAYS BE THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE DESTRUCTION IN A GIVEN TIME*{:.small}.” Yet “*THIS IS WHY THE OTHER WORLD HAS ALWAYS NEEDED TO BE CREATED*{:.small}.” A sort of inverted deus ex machina, more overture than resolution, “Mosaic” is a fitting coda to Reines’s Exodus, reminding that all stories, all times, are simultaneously unique and common, discrete and continuous. Reines reflects that “Sand was the place between two worlds.” In “A Sand Book,” apocalypse becomes an invitation—an imperative—to remember the past and imagine the future, to insist on a promised land that we, like the Old Testament prophet, may finally never enter.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7a36cecf40192141cf","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c7a36cecf40192141cf","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Poetry","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"poetry"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Poetry","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"poetry"},{"id":"5c2e1c764a08312cd3aa6c35","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c764a08312cd3aa6c35","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Literature","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"literature"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Literature","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"literature"},{"id":"5c2e6270a23f7a2cc1a7cb9d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e6270a23f7a2cc1a7cb9d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books"},{"id":"5c2e214c0534ce2cb4c560c3","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Books","parent":[{"id":"5c2e214c0534ce2cb4c560c3","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"books"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907eefc98449f3364193d6d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5907eefc98449f3364193d6d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Page-Turner","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"page-turner"},{"id":"5908f18c98449f3364193dfd","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"Page-Turner","parent":[{"id":"5908f18c98449f3364193dfd","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"page-turner"}]},"channel":"Books","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"id":"59adad758ef815459f6e7e56","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Hannah

chorus, “we” who tell the story, and on balconies, the wind    fondles laundry lines.\n\nALFONSO BARABINSKI—puppeteer, Sonya’s newlywed husband.\n\nSONYA BARABINSKI—Vasenka’s best puppeteer, Alfonso’s newlywed wife, and pregnant.\n\nCHILD—inside Sonya, seahorse-size, sleeping, and later, Anushka.\n\nPETYA—deaf boy, Sonya’s cousin.\n\nMOMMA GALYA ARMOLINSKAYA—puppet theatre owner, instigates insurgency.\n\nGALYA’S PUPPETEERS—teach signs from the theatre balcony, as if regulating traffic:\n\nfor Soldier*—finger like a beak pecks one eye.\n\nfor Snitch*—fingers peck both eyes.\n\nfor Army Jeep*—clenched fist moves forward.\n\nSOLDIERS—arrive in Vasenka to “protect our freedom,” speaking a language no one understands. \n\nPUPPETS—hang on doors and porches of the families of the arrested, except for one puppet lying on the cement: a middle-aged woman wearing a child like a broken arm, her mouth filling with snow.\n\n[SIGN: “Town”]\n\n##Gunshot\n\nOur country is the stage. \n\nWhen soldiers march into town, public assemblies are officially prohibited. But today, neighbors flock to the piano music from Sonya and Alfonso’s puppet show in Central Square. Some of us have climbed up into trees, others hide behind benches and telegraph poles. \n\nWhen Petya, the deaf boy in the front row, sneezes, the sergeant puppet collapses, shrieking. He stands up again, snorts, shakes his fist at the laughing audience. \n\nAn army jeep swerves into the square, disgorging its own Sergeant. \n\n*Disperse immediately*!\n\n*Disperse immediately!* the puppet mimics in a wooden falsetto. \n\nEveryone freezes except Petya, who keeps giggling. Someone claps a hand over his mouth. The Sergeant turns toward the boy, raising his finger. \n\n*You*!\n\n*You!* the puppet raises a finger. \n\nSonya watches her puppet, the puppet watches the Sergeant, the Sergeant watches Sonya and Alfonso, but the rest of us watch Petya lean back, gather all the spit in his throat, and launch it at the Sergeant. \n\nThe sound we do not hear lifts the gulls off the water. \n\n##As Soldiers March, Alfonso Covers the Boy’s Face with a Newspaper\n\nFourteen people, most of us strangers,\n\nwatch Sonya kneel by Petya \n\nshot in the middle of the street.\n\nShe picks up his spectacles shining like two coins, balances them on his nose.\n\nObserve this moment\n\n—how it convulses—\n\nSnow falls and the dogs run into the streets like medics. \n\nFourteen of us watch:\n\nSonya kisses his forehead—her shout a hole\n\ntorn in the sky, it shimmers the park benches, porch lights. \n\nWe see in Sonya’s open mouth \n\nthe nakedness\n\nof a whole nation.\n\nShe stretches out \n\nbeside the little snowman napping in the middle of the street.\n\nAs picking up its belly the country runs.\n\n##Deafness, an Insurgency, Begins\n\nOur country woke up next morning and refused to hear soldiers. \n\nIn the name of Petya, we refuse.\n\nAt six A.M., when soldiers compliment girls in the alley, the girls slide by, pointing to their ears. At eight, the bakery door is shut in soldier Ivanoff’s face, though he’s their best customer. At ten, Momma Galya chalks NO ONE HEARS YOU on the gates of the soldiers’ barracks. \n\nBy eleven A.M., arrests begin.  \n\nOur hearing doesn’t weaken, but something silent in us strengthens.\n\nAfter curfew, families of the arrested hang homemade puppets out of their windows. The streets empty but for the squeaks of strings and the tap tap, against the buildings, of wooden fists and feet.\n\n      In the ears of the town, snow falls.\n\n[SIGN: “Town”]\n\n##Alfonso Stands Answerable\n\nMy people, you were really something fucking fine \n\non the morning of first arrests:\n\nour men, once frightened, bound to their beds, now stand up like human masts—\n\ndeafness passes through us like a police whistle.\n\nHere then I \n\ntestify:\n\neach of us \n\ncomes home, shouts at a wall, at a stove, at a refrigerator, at himself. Forgive me, I \n\nwas not honest with you, \n\nlife—\n\nto you I stand answerable.\n\nI run etcetera with my legs and my hands etcetera I run down Vasenka Street etcetera—\n\nWhoever listens:\n\nthank you for the feather on my tongue,\n\nthank you for our argument that ends, thank you for deafness, \n\nLord, such fire \n\nfrom a match you never lit.\n\n[SIGN: “The town watches”]\n\n##Soldiers Aim at Us\n\nThey fire\n\nas the crowd of women flees inside the nostrils of searchlights\n\n—may God have a photograph of this—\n\nin the piazza’s bright air, soldiers drag Petya’s body and his head \n\nbangs the stairs. I\n\nfeel through my wife’s shirt the shape \n\nof our child.\n\nSoldiers drag Petya up the stairs and homeless dogs, thin as philosophers, \n\nunderstand everything and bark and bark.\n\nI, now on the bridge, with no camouflage of speech, a body\n\nwrapping the body of my pregnant wife—\n\nTonight\n\nwe don’t die and don’t die,\n\nthe earth is still,\n\na helicopter eyeballs my wife—\n\nOn earth\n\na man cannot flip a finger at the sky: \n\neach man is already \n\na finger flipped at the sky.\n\n[SIGN: “Army convoy”]\n\n[SIGN: “Hide”]\n\n##Checkpoints\n\nIn the streets, soldiers install hearing checkpoints and nail announcements on posts and doors:\n\nDEAFNESS IS A CONTAGIOUS DISEASE. FOR YOUR OWN PROTECTION, ALL SUBJECTS IN CONTAMINATED AREAS MUST SURRENDER TO BE QUARANTINED WITHIN 24 HOURS!\n\nSonya and Alfonso teach signs in Central Square. When a patrol walks by, they sit on their hands. We see the Sergeant stop a woman on her way to the market, but she cannot hear. He loads her into a truck. He stops another. She does not hear. He loads her into a truck. A third points to her ears.\n\nIn these avenues, deafness is our only barricade.\n\n[SIGN: “Match”]\n\nElegy\n\n*Six words*,\n\n*Lord*:\n\nplease ease\n\nof song\n\nmy tongue.\n\n[SIGN: “The town watches”]\n\n##Eulogy\n\n*You must speak not only of great devastation*—\n\n\nwe heard that not from a philosopher \nbut from our neighbor, Alfonso—\n\nhis eyes closed, he climbed other people’s porches and recited \n\nto his child our National Anthem:\n\n*You must speak not only of great devastation*—\n\nwhen his child cried, he \n\nmade her a newspaper hat and squeezed his silence \n\nlike two pleats of an accordion:\n\n*We must speak not only of great devastation*—\n\nand he played that accordion out of tune in a country\n\n\nwhere the only musical instrument is the door.\n\n[SIGN: “Story” (captioned)]\n\n##Galya’s Toast\n\nTo your voice, a mysterious virtue,\n\nto the twenty-six bones of one foot, the four dimensions of breathing,\n\nto pine, redwood, sword fern, peppermint,\n\nto hyacinth and bluebell lily,\n\nto the train conductor’s donkey on a rope,\n\nto the smell of lemons, a boy pissing splendidly against the trees.\n\nBless each thing on earth until it sickens,\n\nuntil each ungovernable heart admits: I confused mysel*f\n\n*and yet I loved—and what I love*d\n\n*I forgot, what I forgot brought glory to my travels*,\n\n*to you I travelled as close as I dared, Lord*.\n\n[SIGN: “Earth”]\n\n[SIGN: “The town watches”]\n\n##And Yet, on Some Nights\n\nOur country has surrendered.\n\nYears later, some will say none of this happened; the shops were open, we were happy and went to see puppet shows in the park. \n\nAnd yet, on some nights, townspeople dim the lights and teach their children to sign. Our country is the stage: when patrols march, we sit on our hands. *Don’t be afraid,* a child signs to a tree, a door.\n\nWhen patrols march, the avenues empty. Air empties, but for the squeaks of strings and the *tap tap* of wooden fists against the walls.\n\n                                             \n\nWe are sitting in the audience, still.

I watch neighbors open \n\ntheir phones to watch \n\na cop demanding a man’s driver’s license. When a man reaches for his wallet, the cop\n\nshoots. Into the car window. Shoots.\n\nIt is a peaceful country.\n\n \n\nWe pocket our phones and go.\n\nTo the dentist,\n\nto pick up the kids from school,\n\nto buy shampoo\n\nand basil.\n\n \n\nOurs is a country in which a boy shot by police lies on the pavement \n\nfor hours.\n\nWe see in his open mouth\n\nthe nakedness \n\nof the whole nation.\n\nWe watch. Watch\n\nothers watch.\n\nThe body of a boy lies on the pavement exactly like the body of a boy—\n\n \n\nIt is a peaceful country.\n\nAnd it clips our citizens’ bodies\n\neffortlessly, the way the President’s wife trims her toenails.\n\n \n\nAll of us\n\nstill have to do the hard work of dentist appointments,\n\nof remembering to make\n\na summer salad: basil, tomatoes, it is a joy, tomatoes, add a little salt.\n\n \n\nThis is a time of peace.\n\n \n\nI do not hear gunshots,\n\nbut watch birds splash over the back yards of the suburbs. How bright is the sky\n\nas the avenue spins on its axis.\n\nHow bright is the sky (forgive me) how bright.\n\n*Notes*\n\nON SIGNS: In Vasenka, the townspeople invented their own sign language. Some of the signs derived from various traditions (Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, American Sign Language, etc.). Other signs might have been made up by citizens, as they tried to create a language not known to authorities.\n\nON SILENCE: The deaf don’t believe in silence.

The former nods to the titular playwright’s absurdism, ironizing the speaker’s quixotic pursuit of meaning in a world of senseless cruelty; the latter draws an unsettling connection between pain and poetry, musing, “If the happiness lasts, / it is the smoothness. The part / we do not notice. The language he made / was from the bruises.” The echo of “smoothness” in “bruises” is typical of Gregg’s acute yet playful ear; her work explores language’s textures through sound in tandem with signification. “[A Game Called Fear](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1980/06/30/a-game-called-fear),” for example, opens on an ambiguity—“The young cows run in the sound of the river, / making a noise on the grass”—and goes on to rhyme “water” with “white air,” drawing the elements together but also emphasizing them as distinct. This skill for elision returns, evocatively, in “[Saying Goodbye to the Dead](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1984/02/27/saying-goodbye-to-the-dead),” which begins, “I walk on the dirt roads being my father”—the speaker at once Christlike and tellurian in loss.\n\nSublimity arises from incongruity again in “[Elegance](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/01/07/elegance-4),” from 2002, which praises “All that is uncared for,” where Gregg finds “Accurate / and unexpected beauty, rattling / and singing.” “[Now I Understand](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/06/14/now-i-understand)” presses the seam between absence and presence, starting, “Something was pouring out. Filling the field / and making it vacant.” Proceeding in a series of stirring images whose unstated connection is implicit and intuitive, the poem does not so much describe as animate a certain ambivalent eros, culminating, “One could call it the agony in the garden, / or the paradise, depending on whether / the joy was at the beginning, or after.” The question of emptiness and abundance resurfaces in “[Arriving Again and Again Without Noticing](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/01/16/arriving-again-and-again-without-noticing),” where Gregg writes, “I finally fell in love with all of it,” reflecting, “It’s strange that my heart is as full / now as my desire was then.”\n\nParadox lies at the heart of Gregg’s work, which traces the intimacy of apartness, the otherwise-imperceptible movements of even the most perfect stillness; her poems are like atomic nuclei—precisely calibrated, powerfully charged instances of transfixion from which worlds are built. “[The Otherness](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/01/26/the-otherness),” from 2004, reads, in its entirety:\n\n>Of course there is the otherness,  \n>right away inside you when  \n>the doe steps carefully down  \n>the embankment. Then clatter  \n>of hoof and the dappled water  \n>with leaf shade. The otherness  \n>and the invisible until you came.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c8681ab3335f580f180","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Poets","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"poets"},{"id":"5c2e1c7a36cecf40192141cf","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Poetry","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"poetry"},{"id":"5c2e1c7622d4972cd5b83286","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907eefc98449f3364193d6d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Page-Turner","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"page-turner"}]},"channel":"Books","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"59adad758ef815459f6e7e56","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Hannah Aizenman is *The New Yorker’s* poetry coördinator.","email":"","name":"Hannah Aizenman","socialMedia":[],"title":""}]},"dek":"","hed":"Linda Gregg in The New Yorker","inlineEmbeds":[],"issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","modifiedAt":"2019-03-23T22:21:44.069Z","photos":{"tout":[{"id":"5c951f1cfc17962d215ffb1e","modelName":"photo","collection":"photos","aspectRatios":{"2:1":{"width":2048,"height":1023,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":497,"height":1023,"width":2048}},"duration":null},"2:2":{"width":1210,"height":1210,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":663,"y":268,"height":1210,"width":1210}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"width":1795,"height":1009,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":79,"y":537,"height":1009,"width":1795}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"width":2048,"height":1536,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":237,"height":1536,"width":2048}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"width":2000,"height":2000,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":47,"y":71,"height":2000,"width":2000}},"duration":null},"master":{"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/tny-services/production/2019/03/22/5c951f1cfc17962d215ffb1d_Aizenman-LindaGreggTNY.jpg","width":2048,"height":2560,"duration":null}},"caption":"Linda Gregg’s poems are like atomic nuclei—powerfully charged instances of transfixion from which worlds are built.","altText":"Linda Gregg.","credit":"Photograph by Hal Lum","filename":"Aizenman-LindaGreggTNY.jpg","revision":4,"tags":[],"title":"","variants":{}}]},"promoDek":"Linda Gregg’s poems are like atomic nuclei—precisely calibrated, powerfully charged instances of transfixion from which worlds are built.","promoHed":"Linda Gregg in The New Yorker","pubDate":"2019-03-22T17:55:54.325Z","related":[],"rubric":"","seoDescription":"Hannah Aizenman writes about the work of the poet Linda Gregg, who began contributing to The New Yorker in 1975.
